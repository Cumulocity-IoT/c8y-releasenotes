### Apama correlator version

This release of Cumulocity IoT Streaming Analytics includes the Apama version 10.15.3 correlator.
EPL apps developers should also refer to [What's New In Apama 10.15.3](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pam/10.15.3/en/webhelp/pam-webhelp/index.html#page/pam-webhelp%2Fco-WhaNewInApa_10153_top.html)
in the Apama documentation.

### Improvements for EPL apps

A new EPL library has been added to support programming in a functional style for quicker development, fewer for loops, and more concise and readable code. For example:

```
// Calculate the average of the values in the sequence = 20
Fn.reduce([10, 20, 30], Fn.mean());

// Filter strings by regular expression using the string.matches action = ["Hello Alice", "Hello Al"]
Fn.filter(["Hello Alice", "Hello Bob", "Hello Al"], Fn.callAction("matches", ["Hello Al.*"]));
// Use Functional() to chain multiple operations: filter out odd numbers, then reduce the sequence to a single value containing the sum = 70
Functional([10, -5, 20, 40]).filter(Fn.even).reduce(Fn.sum);
```

The library provides similar capabilities to Python's `functools` module. It can be added to Apama projects with a new Functional EPL Library bundle which provides two main EPL types: `com.apama.functional.Fn` and `com.apama.functional.Functional`. These provide functional operations such as `map`, `filter` and `reduce` in both a functional style and a fluent style. They operate on EPL `sequence` and `dictionary` containers and on a new "generator" concept that lazily calculates infinite lists.

There is support for partial binding of action arguments:

```
Fn.map(["Bob", "Alice"], Fn.partial(Fn.concat, "Hello ")).toString(); // = ["Hello Bob","Hello Alice"]
```

There are also some new actions to make event sending and listening more concise, including the following:

```
// Initialize an event (providing only the subset of fields you care about), send and extract the request id for use in listener
// (it is also possible to initialize event fields by name rather than by position)
on MyResponse(reqId=<integer> Fn.sendToChannel(MyEvent.SEND_CHANNEL,
        Fn.setFields(new MyEvent, [<any>createRequestId(), "/myrequest"])
        ).getEntry("reqId") ) as response
{
  ...
}

// Listen for events with an identifier matching each value from this sequence, and calls a completion action when all have arrived
// (similar to an EPL "and" event expression). A different callback is executed if the specified timeout expires.
Functional(sequenceIDs)
                 .waitForAllCompleted("MyResponse", "id", onCompleted)
                 .onTimeout(TIMEOUTSECS, onTimeout);
```

For detailed information, see [Using Functional Operations in EPL](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pam/10.15.3/en/webhelp/pam-webhelp/index.html#page/pam-webhelp%2Fco-DevApaAppInEpl_using_functional_operations_in_epl.html).

### Improvements in Analytics Builder

The [Cron Timer](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.18.0/streaming-analytics/block-reference/#cron-timer) block
now has a **Time Zone** parameter to customize which time zone this block is relative to.

The [Alarm Output](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.18.0/streaming-analytics/block-reference/#alarm-output) block
no longer reactivates "Acknowledged" alarms with every modification.
By default, acknowledged alarms are now only reactivated if the severity has increased.
This also ensures that the alarm count is updated correctly.
To always activate alarms triggered by the model, select the new **Always Activate Alarm** parameter in the **Alarm Output** block.

Synchronous output blocks are now allowed to have more than one output block which generates events with any given key (the key is made up of multiple block parameters).
This applies to the following blocks: [Alarm Output](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.18.0/streaming-analytics/block-reference/#alarm-output),
[Event Output](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.18.0/streaming-analytics/block-reference/#event-output), and
[Measurement Output](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.18.0/streaming-analytics/block-reference/#measurement-output).
See also [Analytics Builder > Wires and blocks > Keys for identifying a series of events](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.18.0/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/#keys-for-identifying-a-series-of-events) in the *Streaming Analytics guide*.

### First-time activation of Analytics Builder

In some circumstances, Analytics Builder must be activated by the user before it is used for the first time. If you see the **Activate** button for Analytics Builder on the home screen of the Streaming Analytics application, clicking this will start the process. This process may take a few minutes.
