<td style="text-align:left">The <b>Latch Values</b> block did not start disabled when the <b>Enable</b> input port was connected,
which meant that it generated a pulse signal on the <b>Disabled</b> output port on the first false <b>Value</b> input, which it should not.
This has now been fixed.
The <b>Enabled</b> output port of the <b>Latch Values</b> block now generates a pulse signal when the block is enabled but was previously disabled.
Likewise, the <b>Disabled</b> output port of the <b>Latch Values</b> block now generates a pulse signal when the block is disabled but was previously enabled.</td>
