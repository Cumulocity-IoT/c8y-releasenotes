### Cumulocity IoT Edge Appliance VM

#### Upgrade of Rocky Linux operating system version to 8.10

This release upgrades the Rocky Linux operating system from version 8.9 to 8.10. For details on updating Edge from version 10.18.0.0 to 10.18.0.1, refer to [Updating Edge](https://cumulocity.com/docs/edge/edge-update/). Due to the inclusion of the new Rocky Linux version in the 10.18.0.1 update archive, the archive size has significantly increased, resulting in a longer update process compared to previous versions. For instructions on upgrading Edge from version 10.17, see [Migrating Edge 10.17 to 10.18](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.18.0/edge/update/#migration-1017-to-1018).

### Cumulocity IoT Edge on Kubernetes
Cumulocity IoT Edge on Kubernetes has reached General Availability (GA) and is now ready for deployment in production environments.

#### Offline installation

Edge installation on Kubernetes now offers support for installation in an offline or air-gapped environment. This ensures that the required software, Helm charts and Docker images, are available in the disconnected environment through an [Open Container Initiative](https://opencontainers.org/) (OCI) compliant private registry.

For more information, refer to [Installing the Edge operator (offline)](https://cumulocity.com/docs/edge-kubernetes/installing-edge-on-k8/#install-operator-offline).

#### Metrics monitoring port

The Edge operator's Prometheus-compatible metrics port has been changed from 8443 to 3443 due to a conflict with another core component.

For detailed instructions, refer to [Monitoring](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.18.0/edge-k8s/edge-operations/#monitoring).
