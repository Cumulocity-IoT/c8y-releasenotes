### Cumulocity IoT Edge on Kubernetes
Cumulocity IoT Edge on Kubernetes has reached General Availability (GA) and is now ready for deployment in production environments.

#### Offline installation

Edge installation on Kubernetes now offers support for installation in an offline or air-gapped environment. This ensures that the required software, Helm charts and Docker images, are available in the disconnected environment through an [Open Container Initiative](https://opencontainers.org/) (OCI) compliant private registry.

For more information, refer to [Installing the Edge operator (offline)](https://cumulocity.com/docs/edge-kubernetes/installing-edge-on-k8/#install-operator-offline).

#### Metrics monitoring port

The Edge operator's Prometheus-compatible metrics port has been changed from 8443 to 3443 due to a conflict with another core component.

For detailed instructions, refer to [Monitoring](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.18.0/edge-k8s/edge-operations/#monitoring).
