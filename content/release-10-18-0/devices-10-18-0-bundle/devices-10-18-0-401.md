<td>Device Management</td>
<td>An old data model migration mechanism was erroneously removing installed software information from devices when the Advanced Software Management microservice was resubscribed or restarted. This mechanism has entirely been removed so that existing data is no longer modified.</td>

<td>Device Management</td>
<td>The properties library schema definition for the <code>c8y_SoftwareList</code> fragment did not match the actual managed object properties. Hence, when the <b>Software</b> property was selected in the "Device data" widget no data was shown. The property is now called <b>Software list</b> and displays all software items contained in the <code>c8y_SoftwareList</code> fragment.</td>
