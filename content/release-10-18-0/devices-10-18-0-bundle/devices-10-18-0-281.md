<td>Device management</td>
<td>Simulators did not use inventory POST/PUT templates properly as they did not specify any ID fields for the object they created/updated. This has now been resolved by adding the corresponding fields <code>ID</code>, <code>External ID</code> and <code>External ID type</code> depending on the SmartREST template used as instruction.</td>

<td>Device management</td>
<td>Previously, when loading measurement charts data, there was a performance issue if the measurement series had no units defined, depending on the total number of measurement records. This issue has been addressed and measurements series now load efficiently regardless of units being defined or not.</td>

<tr>
<td>OPC UA</td>
<td>When the OPCUA Gateway created an event with a non-numeric data type, the data value was always persisted with 0 and only events containing a numeric value were persisted correctly. This issue is now resolved and the event values are represented correctly for any type of data.</td>
