### REST API changes

#### Planned

##### Breaking change in the Inventory API -- change of the return code for the deletion of managed objects

As announced with [release 10.17](/release-10-17-0/announcements-10-17-0), as of release 10.19+, if the deletion of a managed object and its dependencies doesnÂ´t finish immediately, the platform will return a 202 (Accepted) HTTP status code instead of 204 (No content).
The return code will still be 204 if the control can be returned immediately.
This change is required to make the API consistent with the HTTP protocol semantics (asynchronous request).

#### Implemented

##### Breaking change in the Inventory API - restrictions for a set of properties

As announced with [release 10.17](/release-10-17-0/announcements-10-17-0), as of release 10.18+, a set of properties in the Inventory API is restricted to internal system usage and cannot be set by external users. This change is motivated by planned features and future use cases.

In case of a request sent with these properties, they will be ignored by the platform and not set.

This change applies to the following fragments: `c8y_LatestMeasurements`, `c8y_LatestEvents`, `c8y_LatestAlarms`, `c8y_LatestOperations`, `c8y_LastAlarm`, `c8y_LastEvent`, `c8y_LastOperation` .

For example, if a user sends a request in the following format:

```
{
    "name": "testDevice",
    "owner": "device_654321",
    "c8y_IsDevice": {},
    "c8y_LatestMeasurements":{
      "c8y_Temperature":{
         "T": :{
            "value" : 25.4,
            "unit" : "C"
         }
      }
    }
}
```
Since this release, the `c8y_LatestMeasurements` fragment will be ignored and not saved.

##### Breaking change in REST APIs

As announced with [release 10.17](/release-10-17-0/announcements-10-17-0), as of release 10.18+, wrong values for `pageSize` or `currentPage` result in a 422 (Unprocessable entity) HTTP status code instead of a 500 (Internal server error) HTTP status code.
