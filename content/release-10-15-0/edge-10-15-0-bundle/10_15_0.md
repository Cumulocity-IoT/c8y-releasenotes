Download the Cumulocity IoT Edge version 10.15 from the [Software AG Empower portal](https://empower.softwareag.com), based on the target hypervisor.

### Security Configuration

The Edge appliance is security hardened by default. Furthermore, there are certain security configurations that you can apply to enhance the security of the Edge appliance. For more information, see [Configuring security](https://cumulocity.com/guides/edge/configuration/#configuring-security).

### Removal of Telnet support

Starting with Cumulocity IoT Edge Release 10.15, accessing the Edge appliance remotely from the Cumulocity IoT tenant using the Telnet protocol has been removed. Software AG recommends you to use the SSH protocol instead.

### Installation and update processes take longer

The installation and update processes perform security hardening of the operating system and other components.
As a result, these processes take approximately 50% longer than in earlier versions.
