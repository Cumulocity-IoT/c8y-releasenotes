<tr>
<td>Connectivity</td>
<td>The performance of MQTT connections has been improved. MQTT devices can now connect or reconnect faster, especially if the platform already has a large number of MQTT devices connected.</td>
<td>MTM-53819</td>

<tr>
<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>The LWM2M agent now correctly persists all registration update parameters. Previously, the LWM2M agent did not store changes of registration parameters, for example, updated registration lifetimes. This is now fixed.</td>
<td>DM-2503</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>OPC UA</td>
<td>In OPC UA device gateway nodes, expected but missing information prevented the completion of the address space scan operation. This is now fixed by skipping these nodes and adding an error message in the opcua-device-gateway log files.
Additionally, the overall scanning speed has been improved for the full and partial address space scan operations.</td>
