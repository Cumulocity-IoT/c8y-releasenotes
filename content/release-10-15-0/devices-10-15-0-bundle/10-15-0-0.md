<td> To improve the security during the registration of a new device, a security token policy has been added. The security token policy settings can be configured by the tenant options:
<br><code>{category: 'device-registration', key: 'security-token.policy', value}</code>
<br>with one of the following values:
<br>IGNORED - the platform ignores additional device registration tokens.
<br>OPTIONAL - If a device requires secure registration, the platform will request an additional security token from the user.
<br>REQUIRED - All devices connecting for the first time to the platform must use an additional token during registration. </td>

<td> For devices having the <code>c8y_Firmware</code>, <code>c8y_Software</code>/<code>c8y_SoftwareList</code> or <code>c8y_Configuration</code> fragment the device tabs <b>Firmware</b>, <b>Software</b> or <b>Configuration</b> are now displayed even if devices do not support the respective operations.

Device Management</td>
<td> The event list and alarm list used to display date values of non-standard properties as strings in simplified extended ISO format (for example, "2022-05-10T00:33:54.317Z"). Now non-standard date properties are formatted as date and time string according to locale (for example, "10 May 2022, 03:33:54"). </td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> In the operations list each single operation is labeled by its description property. If no description is available the text property nested in the <code>c8y_Command</code> fragment will be shown instead now (this usually applies to shell operations). If that also isn't available the default text "No command text or description available" is shown. </td>

<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> A subscribed LWM2M decoder microservice was still visible under LWM2M Resource > Custom actions after the microservice had been unsubscribed but not deleted. This issue is now resolved. When you unsubscribe the LWM2M decoder microservice, it is no longer accessible as a custom action until you subscribe to this service again. </td>

LWM2M</td>
<td> Cumulocity IoT LWM2M now ignores invalid FOTA status reports when they're not expected to be sent by the device. Corresponding FOTA operations are not failed anymore. </td>

<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> The LWM2M agent now accepts the resources of type TIME for creating measurements if the resource's value can be converted to an integer value. </td>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> The OPC UA gateway now performs an availability check on the IoT platform before starting up. </td>
<td>

<td>
Sigfox</td>
<td> The default values of two platform attributes have been increased (from 1000ms and 1000 respectively):
<br>```
<br># defines pool connection acquire operation timeout (millis)
<br>microservice.proxy.pool.acquire-timeout=10000
<br># max number of pending acquires
<br>microservice.proxy.pool.max-acquires=2000```
 <br>
Considering the pool of connections to microservices has a limited size (default: 200, separate pool for each microservice on the core node) this change will allow to smoothen the traffic to microservices in case of sudden short spikes which otherwise the microservice can handle - meaning there should be less HTTP 429 errors in such cases. This also means that HTTP 429 errors might be delivered up to 10s after starting the connection with the proxy (which used to be 1s before). </td>
