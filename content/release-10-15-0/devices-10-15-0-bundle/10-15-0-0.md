It allows devices to provide information about the agent running on them. </td>

Device Management</td>
<td> For devices having the <code>c8y_Firmware</code>, <code>c8y_Software</code>/<code>c8y_SoftwareList</code> or <code>c8y_Configuration</code> fragment the device tabs <b>Firmware</b>, <b>Software</b> or <b>Configuration</b> are now displayed even if devices do not support the respective operations. In this case creating install/update operations is not possible via UI. </td>

Device Management</td>
<td> The count for alarms shown on the <b>Alarms</b> tab in the device details did not include child devices. This is now fixed and the count of the different alarm types is calculated correctly. </td>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> A subscribed LWM2M decoder microservice was still visible under LWM2M Resource > Custom actions after the microservice had been unsubscribed but not deleted. This issue is now resolved. When you unsubscribe the LWM2M decoder microservice, it is no longer accessible as a custom action until you subscribe to this service again. </td>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> While the Cumulocity IoT LWM2M agent read the device configuration and put the device in an initial state, but before the firmware update process had started, it might have happened that the device reported a firmware update error. However, the device should not report any errors, like for example an invalid firmware URL, during its preparation for the firmware update process. Therefore the LWM2M agent now doesnâ€™t check any error codes before sending the firmware or firmware URL to the device. </td>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> The LWM2M agent now accepts the resources of type TIME for creating measurements if the resource's value can be converted to an integer value. </td>

<td>
Sigfox</td>
<td> The default values of two platform attributes have been increased (from 1000ms and 1000 respectively):
<br>```
<br># defines pool connection acquire operation timeout (millis)
<br>microservice.proxy.pool.acquire-timeout=10000
<br># max number of pending acquires
<br>microservice.proxy.pool.max-acquires=2000```
 <br>
Considering the pool of connections to microservices has a limited size (default: 200, separate pool for each microservice on the core node) this change will allow to smoothen the traffic to microservices in case of sudden short spikes which otherwise the microservice can handle - meaning there should be less HTTP 429 errors in such cases. This also means that HTTP 429 errors might be delivered up to 10s after starting the connection with the proxy (which used to be 1s before). </td>
