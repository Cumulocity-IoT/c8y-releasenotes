<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>Fixed an issue in the realtime API where a subscription marked as "non-retriable" could still be re-subscribed after re-establishing the underlying connection to the server, for example, after a Cumulocity core restart or network outage.</td>
<td>MTM-56910</td>

<tr>
<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>The LWM2M agent's registration cleaner reads all the persisted LWM2M client registrations, then filters the registrations which are no longer valid and deletes them. In case of a huge number of LWM2M client registrations the registration cleaner consumes significant amount of memory, which can affect the LWM2M agent performance. With the current improvement, the registration cleaner only reads the LWM2M client registrations for which the registration time exceeds the timeout period.</td>
