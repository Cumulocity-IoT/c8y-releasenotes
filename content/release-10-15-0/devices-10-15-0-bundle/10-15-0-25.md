<td> To improve the security during the registration of a new device, a security token policy has been added. The security token policy settings can be configured by the tenant options:
<br><code>{category: 'device-registration', key: 'security-token.policy', value}</code>
<br>with one of the following values:
<br>IGNORED - the platform ignores additional device registration tokens.
<br>OPTIONAL - If a device requires secure registration, the platform will request an additional security token from the user.
<br>REQUIRED - All devices connecting for the first time to the platform must use an additional token during registration. </td>

LWM2M</td>

<br>- communicate with a device which supports LWM2M v1.1
<br>- send composite read, observe and write operations to a LWM2M v1.1 device and read the composite data sent from the device
<br>- read single or composite device sent resource data </td>

<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> If the data sent from the client contains the common timestamp resources 5518 and 6050 or the specific timestamp resource for object 6, then the LWM2M agent may use this timestamp. This can be enabled setting the device property <code>enableResourceLevelTimestamp</code>. Currently this property is set to "false" because of backward compatibility, so by default the LWM2M agent still uses it's own date and time for the measurement data. </td>

Sigfox</td>
<td> The default values of two platform attributes have been increased (from 1000ms and 1000 respectively):
<br><code># defines pool connection acquire operation timeout (millis)
<br>microservice.proxy.pool.acquire-timeout=10000
<br># max number of pending acquires
<br>microservice.proxy.pool.max-acquires=2000</code>
 <br>
Considering the pool of connections to microservices has a limited size (default: 200, separate pool for each microservice on the core node) this change will allow to smoothen the traffic to microservices in case of sudden short spikes which otherwise the microservice can handle - meaning there should be less HTTP 429 errors in such cases. This also means that HTTP 429 errors might be delivered up to 10s after starting the connection with the proxy (which used to be 1s before). </td>
