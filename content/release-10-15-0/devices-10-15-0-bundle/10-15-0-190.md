<td>Device Management</td>
<td>The data type mapping for the "Asset properties" widget has been improved to ignore null values for properties created by default when using MQTT templates, which prevented users from saving widget data unless the mentioned properties were fixed manually. Affected properties: c8y_Firmware.url, c8y_Software.url, c8y_Mobile.imei, c8y_Mobile.imsi, c8y_Mobile.cellId, c8y_Mobile.lac, c8y_Mobile.mcc, c8y_Mobile.mnc.</td>
<td>MTM-48962</td>

<tr>
<td>Device Management</td>
<td>The <b>Submit</b> button in the "Device data" widgets editor is now always enabled. The validation on fields is still present, but validation errors no longer prevent users from submitting manual changes.</td>
<td>DM-1623</td>

<tr>
<td>Device Management</td>
<td>In the <b>Device protocols</b> page, filtering for specific device protocols using a search term is now more efficient. The list is filled and displayed faster with the desired search results.</td>
<td>DM-912</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>OPCUA</td>
<td>
Due to a change introduced in 10.14, the opcua-device-gateway, on OPC UA server connects or reconnects, did a full device type matching with a comparison of device types to the server's address space to find matched nodes and the application of these matched nodes. With this fix, the opcua-device-gateway directly applies the matched nodes settings if there was a matching done previously and no more recent updates to the device types were done.</td>
