<td>Device management</td>
<td>On the <b>Measurements</b> tab in the device details, a tooltip has been added which shows the complete values in case of truncated values in the Y-axis. Moreover, the information is provided that you can see the complete values by hovering over the axis.</td>

<tr>
<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>When reading an entire LWM2M object, which contains multiple object instances, in a simple read, observer or send operation, the LWM2M agent processed and stored only one of the resources of these object instances. This is now resolved and the LWM2M agent processes and stores all resource data from multiple object instances correctly.</td>
<td>DM-2426</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>If the LWM2M device observation frequency is high, for example, a few milliseconds, the LWM2M agent processed the same message multiple times, occupying a lot of resources. This is now resolved. The LWM2M agent no longer reprocesses the same observation request.</td>
<td>DM-1823</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>OPC UA</td>
<td>The application of OPC UA device protocols was unreliable when there were more than 1000 protocols. This is now fixed.</td>
