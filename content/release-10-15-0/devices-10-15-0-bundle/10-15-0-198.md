- The LWM2M agent always retrieved the external decoder events from one month back only. So if an event remained unprocessed over a month, then it wasn't processed anymore. The time period is now configurable from the agent's configuration.
<br>
- Events, measurements, and alarms created by the LWM2M agent are flushed every 10 mins. If a high number of devices connects concurrently or in a short time period, the size of the queue can increase significantly, which in turn leads to high memory usage until all elements are flushed. The flush time interval can now be configured from the agent's properties.</td>
