Release 10.15.0 includes the following new features or major feature enhancements.

### Improved All devices page

In an effort to provide you a more consistent experience across the platform the **All devices** page has been re-shaped. It is now implemented in the data grid fashion you already are familiar with from **Subassets** and **Search** pages. This offers improved appearence in various viewport sizes, easier filtering and sorting, pagination option (only for users with global inventory access) and sets solid ground for further improvements.
