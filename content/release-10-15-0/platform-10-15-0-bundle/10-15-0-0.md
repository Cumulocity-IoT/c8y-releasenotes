### Improvements

Description</th>
<th>
Issue</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td> Duplicating an application is now directly possible from the application list. Moreover, the process of duplicating a subscribed application has been improved. The application name, key and path will now be kept from the original application per default. </td>
<td>
MTM-45075</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td> Fixed the issue in the <b>Status</b> tab of an application, that it subscribes to the /managedobjects/* realtime channel, but does not unsubscribe from it when the user leaves the tab. Now this tab uses the /managedobjects/{{id}} realtime channel instead and correctly unsubscribes from it. It prevents the unnecessary communication between the UI application and core nodes (less realtime notifications), which otherwise could lead to higher resources usage on backend (CPU and memory). </td>
<td>
MTM-45279</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td> For users with TOTP enabled, the <b>Enforce TOTP setup for the user</b> checkbox is now disabled until the <b>Revoke TOTP secret</b> button has been clicked. </td>
<td>
MTM-36755</td>
</tr>

tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td> The user creation API and the tenant creation API now require the email address property value as mandatory. </td>
<td>
MTM-34357</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Authentication</td>
<td> When the preferred login mode is set to Basic Auth, then the Basic Auth restrictions are hidden, to avoid the situation that the user can turn on "Forbidden for web browsers" and then gets blocked from logging into the platform. </td>
<td>
MTM-45534</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Inventory roles</td>
<td> Optimized the resources usage on the core platform for inventory roles and inventory hierarchy related requests. </td>
<td>
MTM-45224</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Mongo</td>
<td>The X-Request-ID value is now propagated to the mongo queries and will be visible in MongoDB logs. </td>
<td>
MTM-43239</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
REST API</td>
<td> The measurement creation performance has been improved by removing redundant read requests to the database. </td>
<td>
MTM-44162</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
REST API</td>
<td> Responses to a GET request to <code>/tenant/currentTenant</code> now also return the parent tenant when queried with <code>withParent=true</code>. </td>
<td>
MTM-43806</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
SmartREST</td>
<td> A new static SmartREST operation response template is available for the device to handle advanced software operations:
<br>
<br>529,serial,softwareToBeUpdated1,version1,softwareType1,url1,action1,sw2,ver2,swType2,url2,action,... </td>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td> On duplicating a hosted application, the application manifest (<i>cumulocity.json</i> file) of the cloned application will now be updated if the application name, key or path has been changed. </td>

MTM-45153</td>

Audit logs</td>
<td> To support white-labeling, the term "Cumulocity" has been removed from the login audit log entries. </td>
<td>
MTM-43936</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Authentication</td>
<td> Setting token and session timeouts to values bigger then 2^31 (or to invalid values such as text strings) do no longer cause the creation of incorrect sessions and do no longer lock out users. If an invalid value is used, the system uses the default timeout instead. </td>

Authentication</td>

Enterprise Tenant</td>
<td> On the <b>Branding</b> tab, only supported image file formats can now be set for:
<br>- Favicon: *.ico
<br>- Brand logo: *.png, *.svg, *.jpg
<br>- Navigator logo: *.png, *.svg, *.jpg </td>

<tr>
<td>
MQTT</td>
<td> Previously MQTT QoS in consecutive subscriptions to one topic could not be lowered. For example, when subscribing with QoS=2, and unsubscribing and subscribing to the same topic with QoS=1, the platform ignored this and still worked with QoS=2. Now it works as requested. </td>
<td>
MTM-38437</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
UI</td>
<td> Fixed an issue with missing buttons and links to the <i>User guide</i> in empty pages, for example in the <b>Global smart rules</b> page in the Cockpit application. </td>
