<td>During the reset password process the tenant ID setup dialog was presented in certain cases instead of the reset password dialog. Now the reset password dialog appears correctly if the reset link is used.</td>

<tr>
<td>Single sign-on</td>
<td>To prevent potential misconfiguration, trial tenants created in the Software AG Cloud are by default not allowed to access the single sign-on configuration. Via a REST endpoint the Management tenant can restrict or allow the access to the single sign-on configuration for specific tenants. Refer to <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.15.0/users-guide/administration/#configuration-access">Configuration access</a> in the <i>User guide</i> for more details.
<br><br>
<b>Note</b> that with this fix the REST endpoint, assuming the Management tenant was configured accordingly, does prevent saving changes. However, the UI might still offer the option to do changes. These changes cannot be saved. This option in the UI will be removed in on of the next maintenance releases.</td>
