<td> A new KPI widget has been added. It displays the latest measurement value of a specified measurement in realtime.
Depending on the user preferences the following options can be configured:
<br>- icon to be shown next to the value for thematic classification
<br>- if a trend (up/down/steady) between the last two received measurement values indicated by an arrow icon should be visible
<br>- if the timestamp of the last measurement should be visible.
<br> In addition, the color of the measurement value switches to orange/red if the value is within the orange/red range configured for the datapoint. See also <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.15.0/users-guide/cockpit/#widgets-collection/" class="no-ajaxy">Cockpit > Widgets collection<a/> in the <i>User guide</i.</td>

<td> The data point library has been migrated to Angular. The AngularJS module <code>c8y.parts.kpiAdmin</code> is no longer used in standard applications and has been removed. To include the new Angular implementation you should use the components and services of the "@c8y/ngx-components/datapoint-library" library. The new Angular implementation implements the same feature set as the one of the AngularJS implementation. In addition you are now able to add a description to a data point. Follow the instructions in the <i>Web SDK guide</i> <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.15.0/web/upgrade/#update-to-an-newer-version/" class="no-ajaxy">Upgrade > Updating the Web SDK version<a/> when upgrading your existing web applications.</td>

<td> To improve the quality of our product, certain events triggered by the users are tracked with a product experience tool (from which the user can opt-out). We improved the collected data by additionally tracking the following events:
<br>- "Connect smartphone" wizard (Cockpit application) - all button clicks in each of the wizard steps trigger an event
<br>-"Quick Links" and "Help and Support" links (all applications) - every link button click triggers an event
<br>- Action bar items (all applications) - every action bar item click triggers an event
<br>- Device grids (all applications) - most important events trigger an event (for example, sorting, filtering) </td>
