<td> The data point library has been migrated to Angular. The AngularJS module <code>c8y.parts.kpiAdmin</code> is no longer used in standard applications and has been removed. To include the new Angular implementation you should use the components and services of the "@c8y/ngx-components/datapoint-library" library. The new Angular implementation implements the same feature set as the one of the AngularJS implementation. In addition you are now able to add a description to a data point. Follow the instructions in the <i>Web SDK guide</i> <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.15.0/web/upgrade/#update-to-an-newer-version/" class="no-ajaxy">Upgrade > Updating the Web SDK version<a/> when upgrading your existing web applications.</td>
