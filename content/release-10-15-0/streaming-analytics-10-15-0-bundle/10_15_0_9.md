<td style="text-align:left">The <b>Alarm Output</b> block in Analytics Builder no longer reactivates "Acknowledged"
alarms with every modification.
Acknowledged alarms are only reactivated if the severity has increased.
This also ensures that the alarm count is updated correctly.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">The <b>Expression</b> block now calculates the remainder of integer division, as already documented.
Previously, this functionality was not implemented and raised a runtime error if defined.</td>
