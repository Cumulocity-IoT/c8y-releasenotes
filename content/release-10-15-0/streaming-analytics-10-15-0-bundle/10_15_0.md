### Apama correlator version

This release of Cumulocity IoT Streaming Analytics includes the Apama version 10.15.0 correlator.
See also [What's New In Apama 10.15.0](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/v10-15/apama10-15/apama-webhelp/index.html#page/apama-webhelp%2Fco-WhaNewInApa_10150_top.html)
in the Apama documentation.

### Improvements in Analytics Builder

Additional Analytics Builder samples are now available in the model editor. The provided samples now cover all of the smart rules from Cumulocity IoT.

Detailed descriptions have been added for the Analytics Builder samples. You can see the first lines of such a description in a tooltip when you move the mouse over the card for a sample, 
or you can see the full description when you view a sample (or create a model from the sample) and then open the Model Configuration dialog box.

In the previous release, the template parameter names in the Analytics Builder samples were only available in English. 
As of this release, translations are available for the supported languages.

The [Alarm Output](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-15-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Output_CreateAlarm.html) 
and 
[Measurement Output](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-15-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Output_CreateMeasurement.html) 
blocks now have a new **Params Fragment** parameter and a new **Properties** input port. 
These can be used to set custom properties, similar to the already existing functionality of the 
[Event Output](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-15-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Output_CreateEvent.html) block.

The [Alarm Output](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-15-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Output_CreateAlarm.html)
block now has a new **Create Asynchronous Output** parameter. It is not selected by default which reflects the block's previous behavior. 
When selected, alarms can now be created and cleared asynchronously.

Analytics Builder now supports the `globalTitle` branding option for the category names in the model editor.
