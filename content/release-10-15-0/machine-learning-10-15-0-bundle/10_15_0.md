### Improvements in Machine Learning Engine

- Enhancements:
  - In the Machine Learning web application, confirmation popups have been modified to provide a consistent UX with the rest of the platform.

* Upgrades:
  * Machine Learning web application upgraded to use Cumulocity Web SDK 1015.0.2.
  * Zementis microservice upgraded from openssl  version 1.0.2 to  version 1.1.1n.
  * Nyoka and Onnx microservices upgraded NumPy from version 1.18.5 to version 1.21.5.
  * Nyoka and Onnx microservices upgraded scikit-learn from version 0.21.3 to version 0.23.1.
  * Onnx microservice upgraded from onnx version 1.7.0 to version 1.11.0
  * Onnx microservice upgraded from onnx-runtime version 1.5.2 to version 1.11.0
  * Onnx microservice upgraded from protobuf version 3.17.0 to version 3.20.0.

- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed the issue where requests to Onnx microservice were failing if User Agent validation was enabled in the OAI settings.
  - Fixed the issue where model group list was displaying the deleted model groups at certain times.
  - Fixed the issue where listed pmml models reported 404-Not Found while attempting to delete them.


### Improvements in Machine Learning Workbench

* Compute off-load with a pluggable Enterprise Gateway:\
With this release, the Cumulocity IoT Machine Learning Workbench provides an integration connection to Jupyter Enterprise Gateway using which it is possible to launch kernels on behalf of remote notebooks. The enterprise gateway exposes a Kernel as a Service model providing better optimization of compute resources, improved multi-user support, enable compute offload capability and more granular security for Jupyter notebook environment.
  - Settings: 
    - A new tab is added to register the Jupyter Enterprise Gateway url
    - Pop-up to notify an end user that all running kernels would be deleted during the setting and delete actions of the JEG credentials
  - Notebook UI: 
      - Pop-up display to select different kernel specs
      - “Jupyter” logo beside the Kernel name on every notebook to notify an end user that the notebook is running using a Kernel spec from the remote Jupyter Enterprise Gateway server
      - Option within the integrated Jupyter UI to insert the code snippets using which a Data Scientist would be able to:
          - Download “Data” from MLW to the JEG server
          - Upload “Models” to MLW from JEG server
          - List the projects available
          - List the resources available within a project

* MLW sdk:\
With the inclusion of Jupyter Enterprise Gateway connection within the Cumulocity IoT Machine Learning Workbench, there was a need to develop a Python package using which the artifacts (Data, Models) exchange was possible to and from the JEG server.

- Enhancements:
  - Project Management UX improvements:
    - Ability to select multiple resources for deletion
    - Ability to delete individual project version
    - Ability to select multiple projects for deletion
    - Tasks, Assets grouping according to the projects
    - Ability to select multiple tasks, assets for deletion
    - Project commit button is restructured to make the functionality more intuitive

* Upgrades:
  * Machine Learning Workbench web application upgraded to use Cumulocity Web SDK 1015.0.2.
  * MLW microservice upgraded from onnx version 1.7.0 to version 1.11.0.
  * MLW microservice upgraded from protobuf version 3.12.4 to version 3.20.0.
  * MLW microservice upgraded from supervisor version 4.2.1 to version 4.2.4.

- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed the issue with vulnerable 3rd Party Component protobuf used in docker image.
  - Fixed the issue with vulnerable 3rd Party Component openssl used in docker image.
  - Fixed the issue with the wrong resource count for a particular project.
  - Fixed the issue with MLW RBAC not working if user agent validation required is checked in Cumulocity Authentication (OAuth) Settings.
