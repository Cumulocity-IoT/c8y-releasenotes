### Improvements in Machine Learning Engine

- Enhancements:
  - In the Machine Learning web application, confirmation popups have been modified to provide a consistent UX with the rest of the platform.

* Upgrades:
  * Machine Learning web application upgraded to use Cumulocity IoT Web SDK 1015.0.2.

  * Zementis microservice upgraded from openssl version 1.0.2 to version 1.1.1n.
  * Nyoka and Onnx microservices upgraded from NumPy version 1.18.5 to version 1.21.5.
  * Nyoka and Onnx microservices upgraded from scikit-learn version 0.21.3 to version 0.23.1.
  * Onnx microservice upgraded from ONNX version 1.7.0 to version 1.11.0.

  * Onnx microservice upgraded from ONNX-runtime version 1.5.2 to version 1.11.0.

  * Onnx microservice upgraded from protobuf version 3.17.0 to version 3.20.0.

- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed the issue where requests to the Onnx microservice were failing if user agent validation was enabled in the OAI settings.
  - Fixed the issue where the model group list was displaying the deleted model groups occasionally.
  - Fixed the issue where listed pmml models reported "404-Not Found" while attempting to delete them.


### Improvements in Machine Learning Workbench

* Compute off-load with a pluggable Jupyter Enterprise Gateway (JEG):\
With this release, the Cumulocity IoT Machine Learning Workbench provides an option to connect to a Jupyter Enterprise Gateway which enables launch and management of kernels on behalf of remote notebooks. The JEG exposes a kernel-as-a-service model providing better optimization of compute resources, improved multi-user support, enable compute offload capability and more granular security for Jupyter notebook environment.

  - Settings: 
    - A new tab is added to register the JEG URL
    - Popup to notify the user that all running kernels will be deleted during the setting and delete actions of the JEG credentials
  - Notebook UI: 
      - Popup display to select different kernel specs
      - “Jupyter” logo beside the kernel name on every notebook to notify the user that the notebook is running using a kernel spec from the remote JEG server
      - Option within the integrated Jupyter UI to insert the code snippets which allow a data scientist to:
          - Download “Data” from MLW to the JEG server
          - Upload “Models” to MLW from the JEG server
          - List the projects available
          - List the resources available within a project

* MLW SDK:\
To complement the inclusion of the Jupyter Enterprise Gateway connection within the Cumulocity IoT Machine Learning Workbench, we also provide a Python package which facilitates exchange of artifacts (Data, Models, Resources) to and from the JEG server.


- Enhancements:
  - Project management UX improvements:
    - Ability to select multiple resources for deletion
    - Ability to delete an individual project version
    - Ability to select multiple projects for deletion
    - Task and asset grouping based on projects

    - Ability to select multiple tasks and assets for deletion
    - Project commit button relocated to make the functionality more intuitive

* Upgrades:
  * Machine Learning Workbench web application upgraded to use Cumulocity IoT Web SDK 1015.0.2.

  * MLW microservice upgraded from ONNX version 1.7.0 to version 1.11.0.

  * MLW microservice upgraded from protobuf version 3.12.4 to version 3.20.0.
  * MLW microservice upgraded from supervisor version 4.2.1 to version 4.2.4.

- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed the issue with the vulnerable 3rd Party component protobuf.
  - Fixed the issue with the vulnerable 3rd Party component openssl.
  - Fixed the issue with the wrong resource count for a particular project.
  - Fixed the issue with MLW RBAC not working if "user agent validation required" is checked in the Cumulocity IoT authentication settings (OAuth).
