### Monitoring the measurements of the Edge VM

You can monitor the measurements like usage of disk space, RAM, CPU, disk I/O, network of the Edge VM in your Cumulocity IoT tenant. For more information about disk space monitoring, see [Working with Cumulocity IoT Edge > Monitoring the Edge metrics](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.7.0/edge/usage/#monitoring_edge_metrics).

### Expanding disk space

You can also increase the disk space of the installation disk. For more information, see [Setting up Cumulocity IoT Edge > Configuration > Expanding the disk size](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.7.0/edge/installation/#expanding-the-disk-size).

### Updating Docker Bridge Network CIDR

You can update the Docker Bridge Network CIDR  while configuring the Cumulocity IoT Edge network. For more information about changing the Docket IP, see [Setting up Cumulocity IoT Edge > Configuration > Configuring the Edge network](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.7.0/edge/installation/#configuring-the-edge-network).

### Changing the hostname
