<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td > The sorting of groups and devices has been changed to be consistent in all places. Previously the sorting of groups and devices in the navigator was not consistent with the sorting in the **Subassets** tab. Now the sorting will be case-sensitive in both cases, for example "AAA BBB CCC aaa bbb..." instead of "aaa AAA bbb CCC ccc...".</td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Monitoring</td>
<td > In the case that availability monitoring for a device was deactivated, alarms were still incorrectly being raised to indicate a device was unavailable. This behaviour has now been corrected.</td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td > Improved app subscription to avoid a race condition bug when applying branding to an application. This was often leading to not/wrong applied branding when creating a new branding.</td>
