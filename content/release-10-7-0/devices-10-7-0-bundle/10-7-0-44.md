LWM2M</td>
<td > LWM2M bootstrap via PSK requires the existence of an external ID, namely c8y_BootstrapPskId. Before, there was an undocumented fall-back behavior that allowed for bootstrapping LWM2M devices
without this external ID if the device could be found using a corresponding fragment. If bootstrap is now carried out using bootstrap in PSK and the external ID is missing, the external ID is automatically recreated if the device can be found in the inventory. Note that this is a temporary and deprecated reestablishment of the fallback behavior which does not remove the need of the external ID c8y_BootstrapPskId.</td>
