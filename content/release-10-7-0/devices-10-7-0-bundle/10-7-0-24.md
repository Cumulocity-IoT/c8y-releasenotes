<tr>
<td>
Actility</td>
<td > New advanced settings have been introduced for the Java Microservice SDK that allow the developer to alter the connection pool settings.
These settings can be considered to be used if the request/connection times out or no route to host exceptions are being experienced for the requests to the microservice. These settings should only be altered where the network environment is fully understood.
<br><br>The following properties, which can be specified in the microservice's property file, are available:
<br>"C8Y.httpClient.httpReadTimeout" (default: 180000 in ms)
<br>"C8Y.httpClient.pool.enabled" (default: true)
<br>"C8Y.httpClient.pool.perHost" (default: 50)
<br>"C8Y.httpClient.pool.max" (default: 100)
<br>"C8Y.httpClient.pool.awaitTimeout" (default: 10000 in ms)

<br><br>Actility microservice:
<br>The httpClient configurations for concurrent request limit to the Cumulocity IoT host (C8Y.httpClient.pool.perHost) and maximum number of connection limit (C8Y.httpClient.pool.max) have increased by default with the following setting in the microservice's property file:

<br>C8Y.httpClient.pool.perHost=120
<br>C8Y.httpClient.pool.max=240 </td>

<tr>
<td>
Cockpit & Device Management</td>
<td > Performance has been improved by making breadcrumbs on devices and groups configurable. Per default, breadcrumbs on devices and groups are now turned off. They can be turned on by setting the <code>breadcrumbs</code> application option, see <a href="http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/websdk/ngx-components/classes/ApplicationOptions.html#breadcrumbs" class="no-ajaxy">http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/websdk/ngx-components/classes/ApplicationOptions.html#breadcrumbs</a>.

<td > The configuration repository functionality has been enhanced. It is now possible to specify a configuration type. Moreover, the configuration repository now provides a list view, which shows the new configuration type and also allows the user to filter for configurations. If a device has the "c8y_SupportedConfigurations" fragment with a list of supported configuration types, it can have multiple configurations.<br> For details, see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.7.0/users-guide/device-management#configuration-repository" class="no-ajaxy">Device Management > Managing device data > Managing configurations</a> in the <em>User guide</em>.  </td>

The following fixes have been made:
<br>- Allow Ethernet WAN and USB WAN connection as well as cellular WAN.
<br>- Fixed the issue that the agent updates its position with different intervals from the configured ones.

At the moment, the feature is only available via Rest API by using device protocol endpoints.<br>
Supported processing modes are PERSISTENT, TRANSIENT, QUIESCENT, CEP for measurement and event and only PERSISTENT for alarm mappings. If the given processing mode is not supported for the mapping then a warning log is given in the opcua-device-gateway logs when the device type is being applied and the default mode (PERSISTENT) is selected for those mappings. </td>
