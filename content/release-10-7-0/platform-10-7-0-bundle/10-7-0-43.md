<td > Breadcrumbs are no longer duplicated on the <b>Simulator</b> page and the <b>SmartRest templates</b> page. The issue occurred since this feature had not been fully migrated to the ngx-component. Now, breadcrumbs in AngularJS can be added in 3 different places/ways:
<br> - c8yBreadcrumbsSet component
<br> - c8yBreadcrumbsProvider by adding breadcrumbs array
<br> - c8yBreadcrumbsProvider by adding function which can be invoked
<br>All breadcrumbs added by AngularJS in one of these ways should now work correctly.</td>
