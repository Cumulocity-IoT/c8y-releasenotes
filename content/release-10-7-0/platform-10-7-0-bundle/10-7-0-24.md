This change was motivated for performance reasons, improving the speed considerably in tenants with large number of groups and devices. </td>

<tr>
<td>
MQTT</td>
<td >  The creation of subscriptions to MQTT topics has been changed to prevent subscriptions of unverified devices. A device is called unverified if the device definition (managed object) doesn’t include the "com_cumulocity_model_Agent" fragment. When trying to do so the client now gets an exception on one of the following topics: "s/e" for errors, "s/dl" for SmartREST 1.0 over MQTT and "s/dcr" for credentials for device registration.
<br>
Note that this change might lead to a situation where existing device registration processes no longer work if they so far did not comply with the device integration process. The basic life cycle for integrating devices into Cumulocity IoT using the MQTT implementation is described in <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.7.0/device-sdk/mqtt/#device-integration" class="no-ajaxy">Device integration using MQTT > Device integration</a> in the <em>Device SDK guide</em>.
<br>In case of any issues, ensure that the order of commands complies with the order described in this description.
