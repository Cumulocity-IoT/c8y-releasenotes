<td style="text-align:left">Microservices migrating from version 10.6.6.26 or lower could experience null pointer exceptions in the microservice log files, and a failure to start upon upgrade. This was caused by attempting to read a value from a field that had not existed prior to this version. The microservice will now set default values and not attempt to read the field if it does not exist.</td>
