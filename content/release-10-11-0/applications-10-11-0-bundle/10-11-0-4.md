Web SDK</td>
<td > In order to decouple the @c8y/client library from RxJS library methods, the use of observables or other RxJS features has been removed. To continue using real-time data in your code use the new <code>Observable()</code>, <code>defer()</code> or <code>from()</code> to compose an observable on your own. For example:
<br><br>
<code>observable(channel: string) {
<br>return new Observable&lt;any&gt;(observer =&gt; {
<br> const subscription = this.realtime.subscribe(channel, msg =&gt; {
<br> const data = {
<br> channel: msg.channel,
<br> data: msg.data.data,
<br> id: msg.id,
<br> realtimeAction: msg.data.realtimeAction
<br> };
<br> return observer.next(data);
<br> });
<br> return () =&gt; this.realtime.unsubscribe(subscription);
<br>});
<br>} </code></td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td > A new utility function <code>toObservable</code> has been added to the Web SDK as part of the @c8y/ngx-components library. It converts any value provided as an argument to an observable, that emits this value and then completes. Developers can use it as a convenient method to handle any value as an observable rather than mixing observables and other types (for example, Promises), and eliminate any checks and conversions in their logic. </td>

Custom index templates can be set in two places: angular.json and package.json. For the Web SDK to work the angular.json is not supported. Instead of failing silently, the developer will now be informed.</td>
