<td>Device Management</td>
<td>In case of many active alarms of different severities, in the "Active critical alarms" widget users might have needed to press the <b>Load more</b> button several times on an empty list in order to see their active critical alarms. This is now fixed - the widget always initially shows active critical alarms if available and the <b>Load more</b> button does not load empty pages.</td>
