<td> When a LWM2M device registration update comes with a different port or address than the previous registration, for example the LWM2M registration update comes with a new COAP port due to the load balancer's idle timeout being exceeded, all ongoing operations that are not finished meanwhile will be set back to PENDING state, instead of directly canceling them.</td>

<td> The resourceValue fragment added to events and alarms now works with opaque resources. Measurements cannot be created with opaque resource values. If enabled, it will create a warning alarm if non-numeric/non-boolean values are received.
Additionally, the type for no-mapping-known alarms has been improved by including the object ID.
