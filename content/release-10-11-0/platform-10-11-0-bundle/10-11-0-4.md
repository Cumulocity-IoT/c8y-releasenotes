Single sign-on</td>
<td > Single sign-on users are managed by an external authorization server, and user details are set based on tokens from the authorization server and mappings from the single sign-on configuration. Some mappings were missing in the previous implementation, that is, for user email, first name, last name, and phone number. Mappings for these user details have now been added to the configuration.</td>

<tr>
<td>Smart rules</td>
<td > The smart rules documentation has been updated to indicate that under certain circumstances, for example, if the time gap between measurements is quite large, the smart rules "On measurement threshold create alarm" and "On measurement explicit threshold create alarm" may raise an incorrect alarm severity. See <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.11.0/users-guide/cockpit/#smart-rules" class="no-ajaxy">Cockpit > Smart rules</a> in the <i>User guide</i>.</td>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td > Breadcrumbs are no longer duplicated on the <b>Simulator</b> page and the <b>SmartRest templates</b> page. The issue occurred since this feature had not been fully migrated to the ngx-component. Now, breadcrumbs in AngularJS can be added in 3 different places/ways:
<br>- c8yBreadcrumbsSet component
<br>- c8yBreadcrumbsProvider by adding breadcrumbs array
<br>- c8yBreadcrumbsProvider by adding function which can be invoked
<br>All breadcrumbs added by AngularJS in one of these ways should now work correctly.</td>

Administration</td>
<td > A contact phone number is now required when creating a new tenant to avoid situations in which an administrator cannot log in when TFA by SMS is enabled.</td>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td > In the <b>User</b> page, the number of entries in the user list was restricted to 100 items. Now, the user list can show more than 100 users.</td>
<td>
MTM-40458</td>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td > An issue with asynchronous tenant deletion has been resolved. Previously, when the platform failed to delete one tenant (for example due to database issues), then it stopped processing the deletion of a task. The fix contains handling errors, which now enable the deletion of other tenants to continue. Additionally, after a tenant deletion task failed for tenants, it retries the operation for up to 10 times. If it fails 10 times, then the affected tenant is suspended and an alarm is raised on the Management tenant.</td>

<td> The <b>New tenant</b> window had some overlapping style issues on the <b>Storage limit per device</b> field, which resulted in unreadable error messages. These issues have been fixed.</td>
<td>
MTM-41498</td>

<tr>
<td>
Billing</td>
<td > The tracker-agent now uses microservice subscription. The registration of tenants tracker-agent-{tenantId} is no longer required. A subscription is now required for new tenants using the tracker-agent. Tenants that have already been using tracker-agent will be subscribed automatically.</td>
<td>

<td > Deleting a non-existing tenant will now return a 404 HTTP status code instead of an error 500.</td>
<td>
MTM-38976</td>

<tr>
<td>
REST API</td>
<td > To avoid issues with the usage of special and control characters when creating tenant options, it is no longer allowed to create tenant options with special HTTP and control characters. See also here for the list of disabled special HTTP characters: <a href="https://secure.n-able.com/webhelp/NC_9-1-0_SO_en/Content/SA_docs/API_Level_Integration/API_Integration_URLEncoding.html" class="no-ajaxy">https://secure.n-able.com/webhelp/NC_9-1-0_SO_en/Content/SA_docs/API_Level_Integration/API_Integration_URLEncoding.html</a>.</td>

<tr>
<td>
REST API</td>
<td> When green password is enforced and the minimal strong password length (<code>system.password.green.min-length</code> property) is higher than the device password length (<code>device-user.password.length</code> property), the system will use the <code>green.min-length</code> value, that means, generate a longer password. Prior to this change, the system rejected auto-generated passwords that were too short blocking device bootstrap.</td>

<br>- dompurify to 2.2.9
