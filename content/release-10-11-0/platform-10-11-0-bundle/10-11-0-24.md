<td> Previous releases of the Data Broker microservice could fail to upgrade correctly when a new version of the microservice was uploaded to the platform.  When this happened, the older version would continue to run even though the new version was available.  This issue could be mitigated by unsubscribing and re-subscribing to the microservice from the Management tenant.  With this release, the microservice will correctly upgrade to the new version with no user interaction required. </td>
