<td> The configuration of the Cloud Remote Access password and salt has been moved to the per tenant microservice settings <code>credentials.encryption.password</code> and <code>credentials.encryption.salt</code>. If Cloud Remote Access has been used before on the tenant and the tenant has devices with Cloud Remote Access configuration, these settings will be added automatically. </td>

<tr>
<td>
 MQTT </td>
<td> The performance of the MQTT subscribe and unsubscribe operations has been significantly improved. This will improve the device reconnection performance for all MQTT devices and will have a particular impact where a large number of devices are re-connecting at the same time. </td>
