<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> On the <b>Bulk operations</b> overview page, the <b>New bulk operation</b> wizard displays a column with the software type of the listed software objects. Additionally, the <b>Select software</b> step offers a searchable dropdown to filter by software type. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> On the <b>Software</b> tab, the <b>Installed software</b> view displays a <b>Filter by software type</b> dropdown box allowing the software list to be filtered by the type of the software object. In the list, if a software object has a software type defined it is displayed as a label next to its name. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> The <b>Service monitoring</b> tab in the device details view and the <b>Service monitoring</b> overview page, which both display information about device availability derived from the number of critical alarms raised and cleared during a given time period, have both been renamed to <b>Availability</b>. </td>
<td>
MTM-42188</td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
A new tab called <b>Services</b> has been added to the device details view which provides an overview of the services running on that particular device. For details, see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.14.0/users-guide/device-management/#device-details" class="no-ajaxy">Device Management > Device details</a> in the <i>User guide</i>.</td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> In the <b>Install software</b> dialog, showing up on the <b>Software</b> tab of the device details view, you can search through software and select one for installation. Until now users could only filter by name. Now you can also filter by software type. </td>
<td>
MTM-42185</td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> In the device details view, the <b>Measurements</b> tab was only visible when the device had at least one measurement. Now the <b>Measurements</b> tab is always visible. </td>
<td>
MTM-43891</td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> In the <b>Install software</b> dialog on the <b>Software</b> tab of the device details view, if the device supports software types, the only software objects shown in the installation dialog will be those matching the defined software types for this device. </td>
<td>
DM-382</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> The <b>Shell</b> tab in the device details now displays a full list of command operations providing realtime updates on operation status and device connectivity status.
Additionally, the <b>Shell</b> tab has been migrated as an Angular component. The AngularJS module <code>c8y.deviceShell</code> (@c8y/ng1-modules/devicemanagement-deviceShell/cumulocity.json) has been removed. </td>
<td>
DM-224</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> For devices supporting advanced software management, the <b>Install software</b> dialog lists all available software items matching the (pre)defined filter criteria (such as device type or software type). When a specific software version is selected the UI checks if the selected version is already present on the device. If the software item is already present on the device a warning is displayed to the user. The warning does not prevent the user from installing the software item again. It is up to the device agent to decide how to handle such operations. </td>
<td>
DM-369</td>

<tr>
<td>
Loriot LoRa </td>
<td> The Loriot agent now stores the spreading factor information from the uplink message in the property <code>c8y_SpreadingFactor</code> in the device managed object. For details, see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.14.0/protocol-integration/lora-loriot/#uplink-message" class="no-ajaxy">Loriot LoRa > Uplink message processing</a> in the <i>Protocol integration guide</i>.</td>

OPC UA</td>
<td> The Swagger UI has been updated to the secure version 3.0.0 to address security vulnerabilities in the previous version. </td>
<td>
MTM-43089</td>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> To achieve higher security, the encryption method for the private key, which is used in the opcua-device-gateway to identify the application, has been changed. As a result, running previous versions of the opcua-device-gateway is no longer supported. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Connectivity</td>
<td> An issue with the <b>Connectivity</b> tab has been fixed, which prevented that users with read-only access to a given device could load the device details. </td>
<td>
DM-627</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> Fixed an issue where the UI was unresponsive after some measurement types had been deleted but were still considered as supported by the device, until the removal of the event had been fully processed by the server-side application. </td>
<td>
MTM-41483</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> The layout of the <b>Logs</b> tab in the device details view has been improved, including icons and list styling. </td>
<td>
MTM-41462</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> In the device profile details view, when opening the <b>Install firmware</b> dialog, the list of firmware items was not filtered correctly. This has been fixed by showing a filtered list with all firmware items that match the device type and the ones with undefined type as well. </td>
<td>
DM-736</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> The LWM2M post-registration operations are delivered for execution via the real-time channel. If the device is not internally subscribed yet, then the pending operations will now also be internally fetched by another process for execution. </td>
<td>
MTM-42865</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> When the protocol resource type is configured as a string it is not possible to receive numeric values which are expected to be processed as numeric data. The LWM2M agent only reads the data and logs a "Measurement creation is skipped for non-numeric value mapping:" message and creates an alarm. The values are not processed, because the agent doesn't expect the measurement as a string but only Boolean, integer or float.
<br>
This issue is now resolved. The agent accepts numeric (integer and float) values sent as a string. In addition also the following strings will be treated as  numeric values:
<br>- Any positive or negative numeric sequence with leading 0 (zero) will be interpreted as octal value, but will be transformed and stored as a decimal number
<br>- Any positive or negative alphanumeric sequence containing letters from A to F, starting with 0x will be interpreted as hex value, but will be transformed and stored as a decimal number
<br>
Strings which do not meet these requirement won't be processed and an error message will be logged. See also <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.14.0/protocol-integration/lwm2m/#overview" class="no-ajaxy">LWM2M > Overview</a> in the <i>Protocol integration guide</i>. </td>
<td>
MTM-43661</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> The LWM2M agent operation handler now handles a Californium library's connector error by setting the operation back to pending state to process the operation later on. This kind of error can happen when sending an operation to a device and there is no longer a DTLS connection with the URI that is used. </td>
<td>
MTM-43663</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> In the custom actions of the device protocols details, LWM2M now only returns decoder microservices which are subscribed to the current tenant. Prior to this change, decoder microservices not subscribed to the tenant were shown as well. </td>
<td>
MTM-41435</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> When searching matches for all device types for a server address space, the opcua-device-gateway used to iterate if multiple device types existed that returned the same result. This situation is prevented now to run only once for the server. </td>
<td>
MTM-43595</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> Integer64 values below the range limits had been converted to double values when stored to the database. As a result the value lost precision because the last 4 digits were rounded. For event values and measurements we now support up to integer64 limits. Long values extending the long limit will be converted to double values with loss of precision (for example, 9223372036854775809 will be converted to 9.223372036854776E18). Due to several limitations the UI will still show rounded values, but the database includes the correct values. </td>
