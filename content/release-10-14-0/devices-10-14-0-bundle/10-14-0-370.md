<td>Device Management</td>
<td>In case of bad connectivity or network delay gateway devices could go to a state where they were disconnected. This resulted in operation execution being suspended. This issue is now resolved.</td>

<td>Device Management</td>
<td>In the device grid, issues with applying filters have been fixed.</td>

<tr>
<td>OPC UA</td>
<td>If the namespace is not defined for a specific node, a missing error handler in the past prevented completion of the scan operation. This is now fixed by skipping nodes that cannot be read. The opcua-device-gateway logs include further details in such cases. The log level INFO contains the failure message and the log level DEBUG contains the stacktrace.</td>
