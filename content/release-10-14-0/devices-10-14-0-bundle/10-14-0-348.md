<td>Device Management</td>
<td>SmartREST Inventory GET templates created in the UI did not generate responses when there was no external ID type declared in the template. This issue has been addressed for both existing  and newly created templates.</td>

<tr>
<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>Multi-line LWM2M post-operations were not executed right after the LWM2M device's new registration when realtime was disabled for the tenant who owns the device. As a result the device might not receive these operations until the next LWM2M device's registration update. This issue is now resolved and LWM2M post-operations are executed right after the LWM2M device's new registration, no matter whether realtime is enabled or not for this kind of devices.</td>
