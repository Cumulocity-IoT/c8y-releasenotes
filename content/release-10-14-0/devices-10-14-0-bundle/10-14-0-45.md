<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> The <b>Shell</b> tab in the device details now displays a full list of command operations providing realtime updates on operation status and device connectivity status.
Additionally, the <b>Shell</b> tab has been migrated as an Angular component. The AngularJS module <code>c8y.deviceShell</code> (@c8y/ng1-modules/devicemanagement-deviceShell/cumulocity.json) has been removed. </td>
<td>
DM-224</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> For devices supporting advanced software management, the <b>Install software</b> dialog lists all available software items matching the (pre)defined filter criteria (such as device type or software type). When a specific software version is selected the UI checks if the selected version is already present on the device. If the software item is already present on the device a warning is displayed to the user. The warning does not prevent the user from installing the software item again. It is up to the device agent to decide how to handle such operations. </td>

OPC UA</td>
<td> To achieve higher security, the encryption method for the private key, which is used in the opcua-device-gateway to identify the application, has been changed. As a result, downgrading to previous versions of the opcua-device-gateway is not directly supported and manual steps must be taken.

Device Management</td>
<td> In the device profile details view, when opening the <b>Install firmware</b> dialog, the list of firmware items was not filtered correctly. This has been fixed by showing a filtered list with all firmware items that match the device type and the ones with undefined type as well. </td>
<td>
DM-736</td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> In the <b>Logs</b> tab of the device details, operations are now sorted descending by creation date, displaying newest operations on top. Scrolling down through the list allows to load and see older operations. </td>

Device Management</td>
<td> A default device type <code>c8y_DefaultDevice</code> is now used if the type is not provided in the CSV file for full bulk device registration. </td>
<td>
MTM-45000</td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> The scheduled device protocol update checks have been improved by querying based on recently changed device protocol items instead of retrieving all device protocols. </td>
<td>
MTM-44024</td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> For devices having the <code>c8y_Firmware</code>, <code>c8y_Software</code>/<code>c8y_SoftwareList</code> or <code>c8y_Configuration</code> fragment the device tabs <b>Firmware</b>, <b>Software</b> or <b>Configuration</b> are now displayed even if devices do not support the respective operations. In this case creating install/update operations is not possible via UI. </td>
<td>
MTM-45139</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> Fixed an issue with saving data in the "Device data" widget when the "LPWAN device" > "Provisioned" item was rendered as a text field. Now it's rendered as a checkbox and the data can be saved correctly. </td>
<td>
MTM-45040</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> The count for alarms shown on the <b>Alarms</b> tab in the device details did not include child devices. This is now fixed and the count of the different alarm types is calculated&nbsp;correctly. </td>
<td>
MTM-44944</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> The LWM2M post-registration operations are delivered for execution via the real-time channel. If the device is not internally subscribed yet, then the pending operations will now also be internally fetched by another process for execution. </td>
<td>
MTM-42865</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> When the protocol resource type is configured as a string it is not possible to receive numeric values which are expected to be processed as numeric data. The LWM2M agent only reads the data and logs a "Measurement creation is skipped for non-numeric value mapping:" message and creates an alarm. The values are not processed, because the agent doesn't expect the measurement as a string but only Boolean, integer or float.
<br>
This issue is now resolved. The agent accepts numeric (integer and float) values sent as a string. In addition also the following strings will be treated as  numeric values:
<br>- Any positive or negative numeric sequence with leading 0 (zero) will be interpreted as octal value, but will be transformed and stored as a decimal number
<br>- Any positive or negative alphanumeric sequence containing letters from A to F, starting with 0x will be interpreted as hex value, but will be transformed and stored as a decimal number
<br>
Strings which do not meet these requirement won't be processed and an error message will be logged. See also <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.14.0/protocol-integration/lwm2m/#overview" class="no-ajaxy">LWM2M > Overview</a> in the <i>Protocol integration guide</i>. </td>
<td>
MTM-43661</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> The LWM2M agent operation handler now handles a Californium library's connector error by setting the operation back to pending state to process the operation later on. This kind of error can happen when sending an operation to a device and there is no longer a DTLS connection with the URI that is used. </td>
<td>
MTM-43663</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> In the custom actions of the device protocols details, LWM2M now only returns decoder microservices which are subscribed to the current tenant. Prior to this change, decoder microservices not subscribed to the tenant were shown as well. </td>
<td>
MTM-41435</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> A subscribed LWM2M decoder microservice was still visible under LWM2M Resource > Custom actions after the microservice had been unsubscribed but not deleted. This issue is now resolved. When you unsubscribe the LWM2M decoder microservice, it is no longer accessible as a custom action until you subscribe to this service again. </td>
<td>
DM-580</td>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> Cumulocity IoT LWM2M now ignores invalid FOTA status reports when they're not expected to be sent by the device. Corresponding FOTA operations are not failed anymore. </td>
<td>
DM-939</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> The LWM2M agent now accepts the resources of type TIME for creating measurements if the resource's value can be converted to an integer value. </td>
<td>
DM-913</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
MQTT</td>
<td> Fixed a race condition, where TCP packets were received in wrong order, resulting in the operation status reverting back to PENDING state on a delivery update. </td>
<td>
MTM-39815</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> When searching matches for all device types for a server address space, the opcua-device-gateway used to iterate if multiple device types existed that returned the same result. This situation is prevented now to run only once for the server. </td>
<td>
MTM-43595</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> Integer64 values below the range limits had been converted to double values when stored to the database. As a result the value lost precision because the last 4 digits were rounded. For event values and measurements we now support up to integer64 limits. Long values extending the long limit will be converted to double values with loss of precision (for example, 9223372036854775809 will be converted to 9.223372036854776E18). Due to several limitations the UI will still show rounded values, but the database includes the correct values. </td>
<td>
MTM-38730</td>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> The issue that static fragments, a property defined in the OPC UA device protocol for event/measurement/alarm creations, were not populated for measurements and events has been fixed. </td>

SmartREST</td>
<td> Fixed Joda DateTime serialization for dates incoming to the platform as part of a custom SmartREST 2.0 request. </td>
<td>
MTM-37812</td>

<td>
SmartREST</td>
<td> In custom SmartREST 2.0 response templates that parse array parameters only the first element was escaped when control characters were used. We now ensure that all returned array elements are escaped when necessary. </td>
