<tr>
<td>Core platform</td>
<td>Deleting managed objects is no longer asynchronous. Delete requests will be blocked until the managed objects and the related data are deleted. Once status code 2xx is returned by the platform, all related data have been deleted. Prior to this change, the platform returned status code 2xx immediately and the operation was running asynchronously. When the operation was unsuccessful the managed objects remained.
The main reason for this change is to make the platform able to reliably delete large hierarchies.</td>
<td>MTM-48008</td>

<tr>
<td>Data broker</td>
<td>The data broker connection handling between source and target tenants has been improved. Excessive resource usage for connectors using the operations API was reduced and it is now properly cleaned up.</td>
<td>MTM-48709</td>
