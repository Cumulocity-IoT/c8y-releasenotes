<td>Enterprise tenant</td>
<td>Due to a change introduced in release 10.14, when a certificate for an Enterprise tenant was uploaded with this version, it was persisted in a faulty way. Although it was possible to activate the certificate when using the new domain this certificate failed to be parsed and the platform certificate was returned as backup. This issue has been resolved. After activating the certificate, the new domain will now be served with the respective certificate.</td>
