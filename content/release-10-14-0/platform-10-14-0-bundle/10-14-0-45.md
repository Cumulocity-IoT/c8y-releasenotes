Administration</td>
<td> It is now possible to log out all SSO users from the platform using the Keycloak (External SSO Provider) admin console. Support for this feature for other external SSO providers such as Azure AD will be introduced in later releases. </td>

<td>
Audit logging</td>
<td> To improve security, a new audit logging functionality has been introduced which provides the possibility to record almost every request (REST, SmartREST, MQTT, realtime, and so on). </td>

Authentication</td>

Data broker</td>
<td> Updated the pulsar-client to version 2.8.2 to address security vulnerabilities identified in version 2.7.0. </td>
<td>
MTM-43194</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Data broker</td>
<td> Previous releases of the Data Broker microservice could fail to upgrade correctly when a new version of the microservice was uploaded to the platform.  When this happened, the older version would continue to run even though the new version was available. This issue could be mitigated by unsubscribing and re-subscribing to the microservice from the Management tenant.  With this release, the microservice will correctly upgrade to the new version with no user interaction required. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Notifications 2.0</td>
<td> The Notifications 2.0 API has a new REST operation to unsubscribe a subscriber from a notification subscription. It is also possible to unsubscribe a subscriber over the Web Socket protocol. See also <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.14.0/reference/notifications/" class="no-ajaxy">Notifications 2.0</a> in the <i>Reference guide</i> or the <a href="https://cumulocity.com/api/10.14.0/#tag/Notification-2.0-API" class="no-ajaxy">Cumulocity IoT API documentation</a> for usage. </td>
<td>
MTM-43042</td>

<tr>
<td>
Notifications 2.0</td>
<td> The "hello-world notification microservice", which serves as an example of the new Notifications 2.0 functionality, lacked a detailed user description. New instructions have been added that provide step-by-step setup, even for a first time user. A new script to simplify the setup process has been added as well, which helps in setting up a measurement device and simulate sending measurements.
See <a href="https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-examples/tree/develop/hello-world-notification-microservice" class="no-ajaxy">https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-examples/tree/develop/hello-world-notification-microservice</a> for full details and instructions. </td>

<td>
REST API</td>
<td>If a user adds the query parameter <code>withTotalElements</code> to a request, a new field called <code>totalElements</code> will be returned. This change is available on almost all REST APIs. The <code>withTotalElements</code> field contains the amount of all documents that this API can return. For details, see the <a href="https://www.cumulocity.com/api/core/10.14.0/" class="no-ajaxy">Cumulocity IoT OpenAPI Specification</a>.</td>

<td>
Administration</td>
<td> In the <b>Applications</b> page it is now possible to delete the current application if a subscribed application with the same context-path exists. Prior to this change, deleting the current application was permitted, which made it difficult to delete custom Administration applications (as this is usually the application used when deleting an applications). </td>

MTM-42674</td>

Prior to this change, the website was blocked unintentionally when the <b>Forbidden for web browser</b> checkbox was selected, while switching the preferred login mode from OAI-Secure to Basic. With this fix, the checkbox is automatically cleared in such a case. </td>

Core platform</td>
<td> Responses to the HEAD/GET requests to the file repository now return a Content-Length header which lets the requesting clients know the size of the files before downloading them. This makes the progress bar in the file repository more reliable. </td>

<td>
Enterprise tenant</td>

<tr>
<td>
Inventory roles</td>
<td> Fixed an issue in Administration > Accounts > Users > (user) > Inventory roles where it was not possible to provide a user access to a subgroup from its owner (in case the owner was not an admin user). Now the list displays all groups and subgroups from the user's owner correctly. </td>
