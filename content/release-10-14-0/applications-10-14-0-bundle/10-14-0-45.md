<td> The asset selector dialog, which shows up to select devices or groups when creating or editing widgets, has been updated. It is now also possible to filter assets on each hierarchy level. </td>

Cockpit</td>
<td> Custom Cockpit applications can now be configured to your individual needs. Certain features can be removed, modified, or added by an application administrator. Additionally, the administrator can let a different group being displayed as the entry node for the asset hierarchy in the navigator. To use this feature, clone the Cockpit application to your tenant and open it. Then navigate to <b>Configuration</b> > <b>App configuration</b> and align the currently used Cockpit application to your needs.

Documentation </td>
<td> A tutorial "Custom widget plugin with Module Federation" has been added to the documentation which describes how to create a custom widget plugin with the Web SDK. See <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.14.0/web/tutorials/" class="no-ajaxy">Tutorials<a/> in the in the <i>Web SDK guide</i>. </td>

<td>
UI</td>
<td> Contextual help is now available in the platform, accessible through a question mark icon in the top bar. This feature adds a drawer with a short introduction on the page's functionality and a direct link to guides for more detailed information. (Link to documentation to be added later) </td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td>The RepositoryModule has been split into multiple smaller modules. This enables the inclusion of specific repositories (for example, the firmware repository) in custom WebSDK apps without being forced to also include all other repositories (such as the configuration and software repository).</td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK </td>
<td>Custom applications built with the Web SDK can now use a component that allows easy selection of assets (devices or groups). This is particularly helpful when developing a new widget, as the context of the widget can easily be chosen. </td>

 Web SDK</td>
<td> A tutorial <i>Add a Jest-based unit test</i> has been added to the documentation which describes how to run unit tests when using the Web SDK, see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.14.0/web/tutorials/" class="no-ajaxy">https://cumulocity.com/guides/web/tutorials/</a> in the <i>Web SDK guide</i>. </td>

Web SDK</td>
<td> Root nodes in cockpit and devicemanagement are now queried via the <code>onlyRoots</code> query parameter. This allows assigning different types to groups so that it is possible now to use groups with different types in the platform. However, this might come with a performance impact if you use a lot of root groups. You can disable this feature with a feature flag called <code>disableOnlyRootsQuery</code> in a custom Cockpit or Device Management application.

<td> The component c8y-ui-empty-state has been migrated to Angular. It is still available in AngularJS as a downgraded component and can be used with the new syntax, see example below:
<br>
<br>Before:
<br><code>&lt;c8y-ui-empty-state
<br>  ng-if="vm.policies.length === 0"
<br>  icon="'c8y-tenant-policies'"
<br>  data-title="'No tenant policies to display.' | translate"
<br>  subtitle="'Click below to add your first tenant policy.' | translate"
<br>&gt;
<br>&lt;!-- custom content --&gt;
<br>&lt;/c8y-ui-empty-state&gt; </code>
<br>
<br>After:
<br><code>&lt;c8y-ui-empty-state
<br>  ng-if="vm.policies.length === 0"
<br>  [icon]="'c8y-tenant-policies'"
<br>  [title]="'No tenant policies to display.' | translate"
<br>  [subtitle]="'Click below to add your first tenant policy.' | translate"
