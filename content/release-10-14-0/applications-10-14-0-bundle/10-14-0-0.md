<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td> The RepositoryModule has been split into multiple smaller modules. This allows to include specific repositories (for example, the firmware repository) in custom WebSDK apps without being forced to also include all other repositories (such as the configuration and software repository). </td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK </td>
<td> Custom applications built with the Web SDK can now use a component that allows to easily select assets (devices or groups). This is particularly helpful when developing a new widget, as the context of the widget can easily be chosen. </td>
