### Apama correlator version

This release of Cumulocity IoT Streaming Analytics includes the Apama version 10.11.3 correlator.
See also [What's New In Apama 10.11.3](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/v10-11/apama10-11/apama-webhelp/index.html#page/apama-webhelp%2Fco-WhaNewInApa_10113_top.html)
in the Apama documentation.

### Improvements in Analytics Builder

Samples are now provided in the model manager. These are similar to the smart rules in Cumulocity IoT. 
The samples are intended to help you get started with creating your own models. You can view the samples, but you cannot edit or deploy them. 
However, you can use a sample as a basis for further development by creating a new model from the sample. 
You can then edit the new model according to your requirements and deploy it. 
See also the information on the new **Samples tab** in [The model manager user interface](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-14-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fco-AnaBui_the_model_manager_user_interface.html)

### Cumulocity IoT transport in Apama

<!-- Copied from the Misc topic of the PAM 10.11.3 release notes. -->
<!-- For 10.13, we also copied over info from the Affecting Backwards Compatibility + Misc topics of the PAM 10.11.1 release notes, 
but put it in the "Important Announcements" of the C8Y release notes
However, this is now about a new property and does not break backwards compatibility.
So I think we can put it here (provided that we also want to mention this here in the C8Y release notes) -->

For configuring the Cumulocity IoT transport, a new property named `CUMULOCITY_INITIAL_DELAY_SECS` is available in Apama 10.11.3. 
It is not provided by default in the *.properties* configuration file. You can add it if you want to set an initial delay (in seconds) for querying tenant subscriptions. 
By default, it is set to 0 seconds.
