### Improvements in Analytics Builder

Samples are now provided in the model manager. These are similar to the smart rules in Cumulocity IoT. 
The samples are intended to help you get started with creating your own models. 
You can use a sample as a basis for further development by creating a new model from the sample. 
You can then edit the new model according to your requirements and deploy it.
