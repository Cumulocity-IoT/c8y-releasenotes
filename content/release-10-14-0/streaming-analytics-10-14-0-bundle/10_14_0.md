See also [What's New In Apama 10.11.3](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/v10-11/apama10-11/apama-webhelp/index.html#page/apama-webhelp%2Fco-WhaNewInApa_10113_top.html)
in the Apama documentation.

### Improvements for monitoring

The following monitoring endpoints are now available for REST requests: `/service/cep/health` and `/service/cep/prometheus`.
See [Monitoring REST endpoints](https://cumulocity.com/guides/apama/troubleshooting/#monitoring-rest) in the *Streaming Analytics guide* for detailed information.

### Improvements in Analytics Builder

Samples are now provided in the model manager. These are similar to the smart rules in Cumulocity IoT. 
The samples are intended to help you get started with creating your own models. 
You can use a sample as a basis for further development by creating a new model from the sample. 
You can then edit the new model according to your requirements and deploy it. 
See also [First steps: Creating a model from a sample](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-14-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fco-AnaBui_first_steps_sample.html)
and the description of the new **Samples** tab in [The model manager user interface](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-14-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fco-AnaBui_the_model_manager_user_interface.html)
in the Analytics Builder documentation.

The [Measurement Output](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-14-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Output_CreateMeasurement.html) block 
now has a new **Time** input port. This can be used to set the timestamp of the measurement and works similar to the already existing **Time** input ports of the 
[Alarm Output](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-14-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Output_CreateAlarm.html) 
and [Event Output](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-14-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Output_CreateEvent.html) blocks.

The [Measurement Input](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-14-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Input_DeviceMeasurementInput.html) block 
now also sends a new property named `value` as part of its output value. This allows other blocks, such as the 
[Text Substitution](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-14-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Utilities_TextSubstitution.html) block, 
to use the measurement value (for example, to use it in an alarm text).

See also [Important announcements](../announcements-10-14-0) regarding the renaming of the **Measurement Input** block's `frgment`property name. 

#### Known issues

The template parameter names in the samples are currently only available in English. It is planned to translate them into the supported languages in a later release.
