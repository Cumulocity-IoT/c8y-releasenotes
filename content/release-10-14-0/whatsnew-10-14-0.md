Release 10.14.0 includes the following new features or major feature enhancements.

### Contextual help

To facilitate the understanding of a page’s content and function for first time users of the Cumulocity IoT platform, introductory texts have been added to almost every UI page that explain the purpose of the page.

This contextual information can be accessed via a help icon/button in the action bar. Clicking it opens a drawer with a short introduction on the page's functionality and a direct link to the specific section in the [User guide](https://cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide).
