##### Removal of application_queue_full alarm type

The `application_queue_full` alarm type has been removed. It has been replaced by three new types of
performance alarms which give a better explanation of why the input and output queues are filling up.
For more details, see the Streaming Analytics release notes for
[release 10.17.0](/release-10-17-0/streaming-analytics-10-17-0).

##### Removal of version 1 API of Analytics Builder Block SDK

The deprecated version 1 API of the Analytics Builder Block SDK for writing input and output blocks has been removed.
See also the announcement in the Streaming Analytics release notes for
[release 10.7.0](/release-10-7-0/streaming-analytics-10-7-0/#10_7_0).
Existing blocks that use the version 1 API must be migrated to use the version 2 API.
See [Migrating input and output blocks to the version 2 API](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/apama-analytics-builder-block-sdk/blob/rel/10.17.0.x/doc/150-MigrateInputOutputBlocks.md)
in the Analytics Builder Block SDK documentation on GitHub for more details.
