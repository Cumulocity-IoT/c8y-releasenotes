##### Removal of application_queue_full alarm type

The `application_queue_full` alarm type has been removed. It has been replaced by three new types of
performance alarms which give a better explanation of why the input and output queues are filling up.
For more details, see the Streaming Analytics release notes for
[release 10.17.0](/release-10-17-0/streaming-analytics-10-17-0).
