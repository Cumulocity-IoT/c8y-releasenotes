Cumulocity IoT DataHub Release 10.17 includes the following improvements, limitations, and known issues:

### Reporting of failed offloading runs

The offloading configuration provides options for raising alarms in case of a failed offloading or compaction run. When activated and a run fails, a Cumulocity IoT alarm is raised, which will be available in the Cumulocity IoT cockpit and can also be queried via the Cumulocity IoT API.

### Look and feel of UI

The look and feel of the UI has been updated in line with the Cumulocity IoT platform UI.

### Limitations

|<div style="width:250px">Description</div>
|:---
|Mixed usage of uppercase and lowercase characters for attribute names in the documents is not supported.|
|If the collection to be offloaded has JSON attributes consisting of more than 32,000 characters, its data cannot be offloaded. One specific case where this limitation applies is Cumulocity IoT's application builder, which stores its assets in the inventory collection when being used.|
|If the collection to be offloaded has more than 800 JSON attributes, its data cannot be offloaded. This limitation also includes nested JSON content, which will be expanded into columns during offloading. Therefore, measurements documents with more than 800 series/series value fragments are not supported.|
|If an attribute of a collection has varying types associated, the result table will contain a mixed type which may render query writing difficult or lead to problems with subsequent consumer applications.|
|Dremio has announced in its [Dremio 4.0 release notes](https://docs.dremio.com/release-notes/40-release-notes.html#deprecations) to deprecate some functionality on mixed types. Since Dremio 13.2, GROUP BY or DISTINCT over mixed type expressions are no longer supported. It is necessary to cast these expressions to a simple type before using them in a GROUP BY or DISTINCT clause. Also mixed type expressions cannot be used in the SELECT clause, when retrieving data over ODBC or JDBC.|
|In previous releases, the *childDevices* and *childAssets* fields were part of the default offloading columns for the inventory collection. They are now excluded from the offloading process as their potentially high number of list items leads to problems. When that number exceeds a corresponding Dremio limit, the offloaded data is no longer readable. New inventory offloading configurations exclude those two fields. For existing inventory configurations, they are automatically added as additional result columns, in order to preserve the set of columns handled by the offloading configuration.|
|When using Microsoft Azure as data lake with IP white-listing being activated, Cumulocity IoT DataHub cannot access the data lake.|

### Known issues

|<div style="width:250px">Edition|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Cloud|Data lake configuration validation is broken in terms of wrong bucket names (AWS S3) and wrong account names (Azure Storage). When saving the settings with an invalid bucket/account name, DataHub fails to quickly detect the problem and will instead run a time-consuming check, which shows up as an ongoing save request in the UI. Eventually the request will fail in the UI with a timeout and the save request in the backend will fail as well. In such a case, please carefully check the bucket/account name and try saving again.|
|Edge|There are no retention policies in place that prevent the data lake contents from exceeding the hard disk limits.|
|Edge|TLS is not supported for ODBC and JDBC.|
