### Improvements in alarms generated by the Apama-ctrl microservice

The following new types of performance alarms are now available:

- `input_queues_filling`
- `output_queues_filling`
- `input_output_queues_filling`

They distinguish between problems with the different types of queues and
replace the `application_queue_full` alarm type, which has been removed in this release.
See [Performance alarms](https://cumulocity.com/guides/apama/troubleshooting/#performance_alarms)
in the *Streaming Analytics* guide for detailed information on the new alarms.
