### Apama correlator version

This release of Cumulocity IoT Streaming Analytics includes the Apama version 10.15.2 correlator.
EPL apps developers should also refer to [What's New In Apama 10.15.2](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pam/10.15.2/en/webhelp/pam-webhelp/index.html#page/pam-webhelp%2Fco-WhaNewInApa_10152_top.html)
in the Apama documentation.

### New multi-tenancy microservice

The new Apama-ctrl-mt-4c-16g microservice supports multi-tenancy, but has limitations in this version.
Currently, it only supports EPL apps and smart rules and does not support Analytics Builder.
Furthermore, EPL apps are only enabled on the Management and Enterprise tenants that own the microservice, but disabled on the subtenants.
See also [Microservice runtime and applications](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.17.0/apama/overview-analytics/#microservice-and-applications).

### Improvements in alarms generated by the Apama-ctrl microservice

The following improvements are available in this release:

- `input_queues_filling`, `output_queues_filling`, and `input_output_queues_filling` <br>
  These are new types of performance alarms. They distinguish between problems with the different types of queues and
  replace the `application_queue_full` alarm type, which has been removed in this release.
  See [Performance alarms](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.17.0/apama/troubleshooting/#performance_alarms)
  in the *Streaming Analytics* guide for detailed information on the new alarms.

- `parent_tenant_not_subscribed` <br>
  This is a new alarm type which is raised for a subtenant that was subscribed before the parent tenant was subscribed.
  See [Parent tenant not subscribed](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.17.0/apama/troubleshooting/#parent_tenant_not_subscribed)
  in the *Streaming Analytics* guide for detailed information on this new alarm.

### Improvements for EPL apps

A new EPL sample named "Create an alarm if a measurement exceeds a threshold value (multi-tenant)"
can now be accessed from the EPL editor of the Streaming Analytics application.
It shows how to write an EPL app which can be executed in a multi-tenant microservice on the parent tenant.
See also [Developing apps with the Streaming Analytics application](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.17.0/apama/analytics-introduction/#apama-epl-apps)
in the *Streaming Analytics* guide.

For more detailed information, see [Working with multi-tenant deployments](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pam/10.15.2/en/webhelp/pam-webhelp/index.html#page/pam-webhelp%2Fco-ConApaAppToExtCom_cumulocity_working_with_multi_tenant_deployments.html) in the Apama documentation.

### Improvements in Analytics Builder

In previous versions, the palette of the model editor showed the names of the devices and device groups that
are registered in the Cumulocity IoT inventory and you had to select the block type in the block parameter editor.
As of this version, these names are no longer shown in the palette.
Instead, the palette now shows the input and output blocks by type.
For example, the **Input** category now shows an input block named **Alarm Input** and
the **Output** category now shows an output block named **Event Output**.
You drag an input or output block onto the canvas and then select the input source or output destination from the block parameter editor.
It is no longer possible to change the block type in the block parameter editor.

For the input blocks, it is now possible to select a smart group as the input source. See also
[Editing the parameters of a block](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pab/10.17.0/en/webhelp/pab-webhelp/index.html#page/pab-webhelp%2Fta-AnaBui_editing_the_parameters_of_a_block.html)
in the Analytics Builder documentation.
A smart group is a special group in Cumulocity IoT which is dynamically constructed based on filtering criteria.
For more information, see [Using smart groups](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.17.0/users-guide/device-management/#smart-groups)
in the *User guide*.

For the input and output blocks, it is now possible to select an asset as the input source or output destination. See also
[Editing the parameters of a block](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pab/10.17.0/en/webhelp/pab-webhelp/index.html#page/pab-webhelp%2Fta-AnaBui_editing_the_parameters_of_a_block.html)
in the Analytics Builder documentation.
Assets represent business objects in general like buildings, machines, production units or cars.
For more information, see [Managing assets](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.17.0/users-guide/cockpit/#managing-assets)
in the *User guide*.

The following blocks now support multi-line input for certain parameters,
which means that your input is now automatically wrapped in the text box and
that you can now also press Enter to start text on a new line:

* The [Alarm Output](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pab/10.17.0/en/webhelp/pab-webhelp/index.html#page/pab-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Output_CreateAlarm.html) block in the **Message** parameter.
* The [Event Output](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pab/10.17.0/en/webhelp/pab-webhelp/index.html#page/pab-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Output_CreateEvent.html) block in the **Message** parameter.
* The [Operation Output](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pab/10.17.0/en/webhelp/pab-webhelp/index.html#page/pab-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Output_CreateOperationStaticValue.html) block in the **Description** parameter.
* The [Send Email](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pab/10.17.0/en/webhelp/pab-webhelp/index.html#page/pab-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Output_Send_Email.html) block in the **Text** parameter.
* The [Send SMS](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pab/10.17.0/en/webhelp/pab-webhelp/index.html#page/pab-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Output_Send_SMS.html) block in the **Text** parameter.
* The [Text Substitution](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pab/10.17.0/en/webhelp/pab-webhelp/index.html#page/pab-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Utilities_TextSubstitution.html) block in the **Text Template** parameter.
* The [Constant Value](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pab/10.17.0/en/webhelp/pab-webhelp/index.html#page/pab-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Utilities_ConstantValue.html) block in the **Value** parameter.
* The [Selector](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pab/10.17.0/en/webhelp/pab-webhelp/index.html#page/pab-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Flow_Manipulation_Selector.html) block in all of the **Input _n_** and **No Input** parameters.

This is also reflected in the **Template Parameters** dialog box, where you can now select
**Multi-line String** as the type for the parameters listed above. See also
[Managing template parameters](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pab/10.17.0/en/webhelp/pab-webhelp/index.html#page/pab-webhelp%2Fta-AnaBui_managing_template_parameters.html)
in the Analytics Builder documentation.

When you move the mouse pointer over the input or output port of a block, the description of this port is now displayed in the tooltip in addition to the port name.

The **Latest Updated** mode of the
[Combiner](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pab/10.17.0/en/webhelp/pab-webhelp/index.html#page/pab-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Flow_Manipulation_Combiner.html) block, which has been added in
[release 10.16.0](/release-10-16-0/streaming-analytics-10-16-0/),
has been renamed to **Latest Input**. This was done so that you can better distinguish it from the **Latest Changed** mode.
