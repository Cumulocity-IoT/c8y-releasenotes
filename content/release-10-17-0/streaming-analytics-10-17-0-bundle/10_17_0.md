to be provided

### Improvements in alarms generated by the Apama-ctrl microservice

The following new types of performance alarms are now available:

- `input_queues_filling`
- `output_queues_filling`
- `input_output_queues_filling`

They distinguish between problems with the different types of queues and
replace the `application_queue_full` alarm type, which has been removed in this release.
See [Performance alarms](https://cumulocity.com/guides/apama/troubleshooting/#performance_alarms)
in the *Streaming Analytics* guide for detailed information on the new alarms.


### Improvements for EPL apps

<!-- TODO: Add more info on new multi-tenant variant of Apama-ctrl microservice later -->

A new EPL sample named "Create an alarm if a measurement exceeds a threshold value (multi-tenant)"
can now be accessed from the EPL editor of the Streaming Analytics application.
It shows how to write an EPL app which can be executed in a multi-tenant microservice on the parent tenant.
See also [Developing apps with the Streaming Analytics application](https://cumulocity.com/guides/apama/analytics-introduction/#apama-epl-apps)
in the *Streaming Analytics* guide.

For more detailed information, see [Working with multi-tenant deployments](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pam/10.15.1/en/webhelp/pam-webhelp/index.html#page/pam-webhelp%2Fco-ConApaAppToExtCom_cumulocity_working_with_multi_tenant_deployments.html) in the Apama documentation.
