<td>This release of the Cumulocity IoT OEE application makes it easier to work with shifts. In addition to the previously available REST API used for defining individual shifts, it is now possible for OEE administrators to work directly within the UI to add, update, and remove shift plans. It is also now possible to define recurring shifts. In addition to OEE calculations over fixed time periods, the Cumulocity IoT application will now also calculate OEE values for entire shifts.</td>
