## Cumulocity IoT Edge on Kubernetes - Public Preview

Cumulocity IoT Edge can now be deployed and managed on a single node Kubernetes cluster using Cumulocity IoT Edge Kubernetes Operator (Edge Operator).

Cumulocity IoT Edge on Kubernetes managed by the Edge Operator enables you with:

- **Unified Management**: Manage Cumulocity IoT Edge through an Edge Custom Resource (CR) in alignment with standard Kubernetes resources. This approach provides a unified and familiar interface for administrators and operators.
- **Desired State Management**: Specify the desired state of Edge through Edge CR. The Edge Operator then ensures that the actual state matches the desired state, simplifying operations and reducing the need for manual intervention.
- **GitOps Friendly**: The declarative nature of CR aligns seamlessly with GitOps workflows. The entire Edge deployment state, including configurations, can be stored and versioned in Git, promoting transparency and traceability. 
- **Automation**: Edge CR empowers you to automate various operational aspects of Edge like scaling, upgrades, and configuration.
- **Distribution**: Distribute and replicate the Edge deployments using Edge CR. Simplifies the deployment and accelerates the adoption of Cumulocity IoT platform across diverse environments.
