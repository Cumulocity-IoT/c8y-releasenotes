### Cumulocity IoT Edge on Kubernetes - Public Preview

You can now deploy Cumulocity IoT Edge on a CNCF certified Kubernetes distribution (version 1.25.x) and manage it using Cumulocity IoT Edge Kubernetes operator. A Kubernetes operator is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. Cumulocity IoT Edge is both deployed and managed on Kubernetes using the Kubernetes API and `kubectl` tooling. 

The Cumulocity IoT Edge Kubernetes operator automates the deployment and management of the Cumulocity IoT Edge on Kubernetes. The operator manages a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) to extend the Kubernetes API for Cumulocity IoT Edge. You can deploy and manage the Cumulocity IoT Edge on a Kubernetes cluster by updating the Cumulocity IoT Edge Custom Resource (CR). Specify the changes in the Cumulocity IoT Edge CR file and use `kubectl apply -f` to apply the changes. The operator uses the CR file to deploy these changes.

The operator provides you with the ability to deploy, configure and manage Cumulocity IoT Edge. The operator also enables you to manage the Edge deployments remotely from your Cumulocity IoT Cloud tenants and update Edge to newer versions. 

The Edge Kubernetes Operator supports the following capabilities: 

- Deployment of Cumulocity IoT Edge on Kubernetes
- Supported across the following platforms:
	- K3s - Lightweight Kubernetes
	- Kubernetes – K8s
	- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
	- Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). 
- Configuring and updating the Edge domain, TLS certificates, MongoDB and Cumulocity Core pods resources.
- Configure Edge deployment to connect to Cloud Tenant for remote management.
- Manage Edge deployments through Kubernetes API and remotely from a Cumulocity IoT Cloud tenant.
- Upgrade or downgrade the Edge version.
