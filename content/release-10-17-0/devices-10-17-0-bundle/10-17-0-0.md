<tr>
<td>Device Management</td>
<td>The device registration wizard had several layout and functionality issues which were fixed by aligning it to the default platform user experience.</td>

<tr>
<td>Device Management</td>
<td>On the <b>Location</b> tab in the device details, you can now again change the location of the device on the map by dragging the position marker.</td>

<tr>
<td>Device Management</td>
<td>In case of many active alarms of different severities, in the "Active critical alarms" widget users might have needed to press the <b>Load more</b> button several times on an empty list in order to see their active critical alarms. This is now fixed - the widget always initially shows active critical alarms if available and the <b>Load more</b> button does not load empty pages.</td>
<td>DM-1646</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>
- The LWM2M agent always retrieved the external decoder events from one month back only. So if an event remained unprocessed over a month, then it wasn't processed anymore. The time period is now configurable from the agent's configuration.
<br>
- Events, measurements, and alarms created by the LWM2M agent are flushed every 10 mins. If a high number of devices connects concurrently or in a short time period, the size of the queue can increase significantly, which in turn leads to high memory usage until all elements are flushed. The flush time interval can now be configured from the agent's properties.</td>
<td>DM-1602</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>OPC UA</td>
<td>Due to a change introduced in 10.14, the opcua-device-gateway on OPC UA server connects or reconnects did a full device type matching with a comparison of device types to the server's address space to find matched nodes and the application of these matched nodes. With this fix, the opcua-device-gateway directly applies the matched nodes settings if there was a matching done previously and no more recent updates to the device types were done.</td>
