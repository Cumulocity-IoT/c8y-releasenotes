<td>Device management</td>
<td>In the <b>Device profiles</b> page, when adding a repository item (software, firmware, configuration) if the device profile has a device type defined, the items shown are the ones corresponding to this device type and the ones that have no device type specified. In some cases, repository items without a filter were not visualized in the window for adding an item. These items are now correctly shown.</td>

<tr>
<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>If thousands of decoder events were pending to be processed, the LWM2M agent tried to process the same event twice in certain cases. As a result, the log file showed confusing SDK exceptions. This has now been fixed.</td>

<tr>
<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>During a large number of parallel LWM2M DTLS device connection requests, used for devices using PSK secured mode, the LWM2M agent was not able to handle all connections at the same time. This caused connection failures for these devices to the platform. In the LWM2M agent, the default settings for this part have been adjusted and made configurable to serve large parallel connections.</td>
