### Platform services

#### Support for new OAuth2 access token type in single sign-on authentication

Cumulocity IoT supports new standard OAuth2 access tokens with the "at+jwt" type header parameter. For more information on this parameter, see [OAuth2 Access Tokens](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9068#name-header).
Single-sign-on users managed by new authorization servers (that is, generating OAuth2 access tokens with type "at+jwt") can thus login successfully into Cumulocity IoT.
