<td>Java SDK</td>
<td>Fixed an issue with the <code>AlarmRepresentation</code> comparison in equals and hashcode methods. Now, instead of comparing the full <code>ManagedObjectRepresentation</code> as source of alarms, we only compare the managed objects ID. There is no change in <code>ManagedObjectRepresentation</code>.</td>
<td>MTM-49181</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Web SDK</td>
<td>The <code>c8y_Global</code> fragment is no longer missing on newly created datapoint library entries.
In addition the <code>DatapointLibraryModule<c/ode> can now be configured to not add the <code>c8y_Global</code> fragment or let the user decide if it should be added.</td>
