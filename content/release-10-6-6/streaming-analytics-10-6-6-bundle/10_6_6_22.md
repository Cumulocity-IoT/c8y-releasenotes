In order to maintain compatibility with Esper-hosted smart rules, the "On measurement threshold create alarm" and "On measurement explicit threshold create alarm" smart rules have changed behavior:

- The upper value of the red range (the one used for the "On measurement explicit threshold create alarm" smart rule) is now inclusive. 
  Note that the yellow range is still exclusive on the upper value end.
- If the red and yellow ranges overlap, the value is treated as "yellow", that is, MINOR, not CRITICAL severity.

For more information on the above smart rules, see [Smart rules](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.6.6/users-guide/cockpit/#smart-rules) in the *User guide*.
