Device Management</td>
<td> Fixed an issue with saving data in the "Device data" widget when the "LPWAN device" > "Provisioned" item was rendered as a text field. Now it's rendered as a checkbox and the data can be saved correctly. </td>

<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> The count for alarms shown on the <b>Alarms</b> tab in the device details did not include child devices. This is now fixed and the count of the different alarm types is calculated correctly. </td>
<td>
DM-875</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> While the Cumulocity IoT LWM2M agent read the device configuration and put the device in an initial state, but before the firmware update process had started, it might have happened that the device reported a firmware update error. However, the device should not report any errors, like for example an invalid firmware URL, during its preparation for the firmware update process. Therefore the LWM2M agent now doesnâ€™t check any error codes before sending the firmware or firmware URL to the device. </td>

<tr>
<td>
DEPRECATED - Core product</td>
<td> The LWM2M agent now accepts the resources of type TIME for creating measurements if the resource's value can be converted to an integer value. </td>
