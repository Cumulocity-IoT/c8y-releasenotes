<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> Fixed an issue with saving data in the "Device data" widget when the "LPWAN device" > "Provisioned" item was rendered as a text field. Now it's rendered as a checkbox and the data can be saved correctly. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> The count for alarms shown on the <b>Alarms</b> tab in the device details did not include child devices. This is now fixed and the count of the different alarm types is calculated correctly. </td>
<td>
DM-875</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> While the Cumulocity IoT LWM2M agent reads the device configuration and puts the device in an initial state, but before the firmware update process has started, it might happen that the device reports a firmware update error. In this phase error reports from the device are not expected. Therefore the LWM2M agent only logs the error but does not fail the firmware update process until the firmware is sent to the device. </td>

<tr>
<td>
DEPRECATED - Core product</td>
<td> The LWM2M agent now accepts the resources of type TIME for creating measurements if the resource's value can be converted to an integer value. </td>
