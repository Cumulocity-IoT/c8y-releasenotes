<td>By default, the LWM2M object-resource mappings of the Management tenant that are configured using the LWM2M device protocols were not inherited by the subtenants. With this change, the LWM2M object-resource mappings defined in the Management tenant are applied to all its subtenants by default. The default mappings from the Management tenant can also be overwritten by uploading the LWM2M device protocol for the LWM2M object on the subtenant level as described in <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.13.0/protocol-integration/lwm2m/#device-protocols" class="no-ajaxy">LWM2M > LWM2M device protocols</a> in the <i>Protocol integration guide</i>. </td>

<tr>
<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>While updating the security info for PSK devices in the database, the LWM2M agent internally deleted the old security managed object and created a new one. Due to the asynchronous deletion of managed objects in the Cumulocity IoT platform, the agent intermittently failed to update the security info. With the current changes, the LWM2M agent updates the required security details in the same managed object instead of removing it first.</td>

<td>The LWM2M agent now allows users to write binary data to a resource on a device using a shell operation. For more details about the shell command, refer to <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/protocol-integration/lwm2m/#shell-commands" class="no-ajaxy">LWM2M > Handling LWM2M shell commands</a> in the <i>Protocol integration guide</i>.</td>
