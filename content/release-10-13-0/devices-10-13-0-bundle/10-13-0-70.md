Device Management</td>
<td>When creating or editing a group, the <b>Name</b> field now correctly enforces the limit of 254 characters.

<td>
Bulk operations</td>
<td> The bulk operation progress bar on the bulk operations overview tab used to round the percentage value to the nearest whole number. For bulk operations with at least hundred devices this led to the progress bar showing a completed bulk operation (100%) even though the single operations had not yet been completed on all devices (<0.5%). The percentage value in the progress bar is now rounded down to the nearest whole number ensuring that a bulk operation will only be shown as completed if all single operations have been completed.</td>

<td>
Connectivity</td>
<td> The check if a mobile device is managed by the currently configured SIM provider is now only done on opening the <b>Connectivity</b> tab of a device. This puts eventual errors in a logical context and reduces the number of checks.</td>
<td>
MTM-40958</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Connectivity</td>
<td> In the Administration application, the <b>Connectivity</b> menu entry had been displayed in the navigator even when there were no connectivity providers to be displayed resulting in navigating to an empty page. The <b>Connectivity</b> entry is now only displayed if there are accessible connectivity providers.</td>

<td>
MTM-39667</td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> In the Cockpit and Device Management application, <b>Load more</b> in the navigator menu is now disabled, while the assets load request is in progress, after clicking the button. Previously it was possible to click the <b>Load more</b> button multiple times before the browser had a response, and that resulted in getting duplicated groups in the list.</td>

<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> The attribute <code>C8Y.lwm2m.enableBootstrapPSKFragmentFallback</code> has been added to the agent's default configuration. If enabled, the LWM2M agent will find the bootstrap PSK ID from the fragments ("bootstrap psk_id") if it cannot be found from the external IDs. See <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides{{< 10-13-0 >}}/protocol-integration/lwm2m/#registration-of-psk-secured-devices" class="no-ajaxy"<LWM2M > Registration of PSK-secured devices</a> in the <i>Protocol integration guide</i> for more information on the fields required for a bootstrap PSK connection.</td>
<td>
MTM-40632</td>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> When a LWM2M device registration update comes with a different port or address than the previous registration, for example the LWM2M registration update comes with a new COAP port due to the load balancer's idle timeout being exceeded, all ongoing operations that are not finished meanwhile will be set back to PENDING state, instead of directly canceling them.</td>
<td>
MTM-41981</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> The resourceValue fragment added to events and alarms now works with opaque resources. Measurements cannot be created with opaque resource values. If enabled, it will create a warning alarm if non-numeric/non-boolean values are received.
Additionally, the type for no-mapping-known alarms has been improved by including the object ID. See also <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides{{< 10-13-0 >}}/protocol-integration/lwm2m/#device-protocols" class="no-ajaxy"<LWM2M > LWM2M device protocols</a> in the <i>Protocol integration guide</i>.</td>
<td>
MTM-41682</td>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> The failure response of a LWM2M operation has been improved when failing on the device side. The message now states that it failed on the device side along with the error code and response returned from the client.</td>
<td>
MTM-41999</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> The LWM2M compatibility with certain Java 8 JRE versions has been improved. However, we recommend you to use Java 11 for executing LWM2M.</td>
<td>
MTM-42596</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> String resources can now again be mapped into measurement values, that is the LWM2M agent accepts numeric (integer and float) values sent as a string. In addition also the following strings will be treated as  numeric values:
<br> - Any positive or negative numeric sequence with leading 0 (zero) will be interpreted as octal value, but will be transformed and stored as a decimal number.
<br>- Any positive or negative alphanumeric sequence containing letters from A to F, starting with 0x will be interpreted as hex value, but will be transformed and stored as a decimal number.
<br>
Strings which do not meet these requirements won't be processed and an error message will be logged. See also <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides{{< 10-13-0 >}}/protocol-integration/lwm2m/#overview" class="no-ajaxy"<LWM2M > Overview</a> in the <i>Protocol integration guide</i>. </td>
<td>
MTM-43661</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> The LWM2M agent operation handler now handles a Californium library's connector error by setting the operation back to pending state to process the operation later on. This kind of error can happen when sending an operation to a device and there is no longer a DTLS connection with the URI that is used. </td>
<td>
MTM-43663</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td> In the custom actions of the device protocol details, LWM2M now only returns decoder microservices which are subscribed to the current tenant. Prior to this change, decoder microservices not subscribed to the tenant were shown as well. </td>
<td>
MTM-41435</td>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> The processing mode set in the OPC UA device protocol is now also applied to the mappings created due to historic read operations with tag type TAG.</td>
<td>
MTM-40524</td>

<tr>
<td>
OP CUA</td>
<td> To achieve higher security, the private key used in the gateway for application identity is now AESCGM-encrypted. As a result, running previous versions of the opcua-device-gateway is no longer supported.</td>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> The creation of alarms is no longer prevented in case a HTTP post action is resulting in an error.</td>

OPC UA</td>
<td> The management microservice now better handles malformed device type JSON and returns a proper HTTP error response (400 bad request).</td>
