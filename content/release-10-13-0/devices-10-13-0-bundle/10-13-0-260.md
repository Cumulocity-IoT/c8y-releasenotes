<td> The OPC UA device gateway creates an application identity certificate to identify itself with the OPC UA server. During the upgrade of the OPC UA gateway from version 10.11 or earlier to 10.13 and later, the private key of this application identity is encrypted internally and saved. The encryption of the old identity was faulty in the earlier releases of 10.13 and later, which led to issues with the server connection using Sign or SignAndEncrypt security mode after the upgrade. This issue is now resolved. Users who configured the OPC UA server after the upgrade, or did a new configuration with 10.13 or later versions are unaffected by the issue. The issue was only during the encryption of old identities. </td>
