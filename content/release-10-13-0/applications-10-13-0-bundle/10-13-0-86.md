<td > A slider component <code>RangeComponent</code> has been added to the Web SDK. The new component allows developers to show range sliders with a Cumulocity IoT layout. Documentation is available under <a href="http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/websdk/ngx-components/modules/FormsModule.html" class="no-ajaxy">http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/websdk/ngx-components/modules/FormsModule.html</a>. The usage example is available in the tutorial application.</td>

Web SDK</td>
<td> The WebSDK now supports, and uses by default, the new Ivy rendering engine from Angular. You can opt-in Ivy on existing applications by:
<br> - Setting "enableIvy" to true in your <i>tsconfig.json</i>.
<br> - Adding the Angular Compatibility Compiler (ngcc) to your scripts in <i>package.json</i>: "postinstall": "ngcc" </td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td> The child devices grid has been improved to work like the sub-assets grid. It is now possible to filter devices, and pagination has been added. The auto-refresh via real-time notifications for the child devices page has been removed as it wouldn't scale well when filters are applied. </td>
<td>
MTM-41003</td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td> The documentation for the <code>c8y-data-grid</code> component has been improved and usage examples have been added to the tutorial application. </td>

Web SDK</td>
<td> Developers using the Web SDK now have the possibility to create named dashboards (dashboards stored with a given name in the database) with a context (device or group). </td>

<td> Cumulocity IoT Web SDK has been upgraded to Angular 12. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td> The AngularJS implementation of the Cumulocity IoT dashboards has been removed. The following modules from the @c8y/ng1-modules package are affected:
<br>- modules/dashboardUI
<br>- modules/dashboard2
<br>- modules/cockpit-reports </td>
<td>
MTM-40537</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td> The AngularJS module <code>c8y.deviceBulkControl</code> is no longer used in standard applications and has been removed. To take advantage of standard UI components for bulk operations you should use the components and services of the <code>@c8y/ngx-components/operations</code> library.</td>
<td>
MTM-41441</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td> A virtual scroll feature has been added to the capabilities of the c8yFor directive. To enable the feature, the parameter <code>enableVirtualScroll: true;</code> must be passed along side with other virtual scroll-related properties.
An example for the usage can be found in the tutorial application documented at <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides{{< 10-13-0 >}}/web/tutorials/" class="no-ajaxy">https://cumulocity.com/guides/web/tutorials/</a>.</td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td> The new application scaffold with c8ycli now by default includes a pre-defined test setup. This allows developers to add unit tests to their custom applications easily. </td>
<td>
MTM-33599</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td> Hooks weren't working well with lazy-loading routes (an Angular feature), therefore plugins couldn't extend any application. Developers can now use hooks in lazy-loaded routes and thus use it to develop plugin extensions. </td>
<td>
MTM-40842</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td> A new template for creating plugins has been added. This template helps you when you want to scaffold a new plugin with the c8y command line interface. You can select the new template if you run c8ycli and select the latest version. </td>
<td>
MTM-37132</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td> The c8ycli has been improved to make the user experience more fluent. A wizard has been added which guides the user through the scaffolding process by asking certain questions. Alternatively, users can still use the previous way of scaffolding applications. </td>
