<td> In the <b>Data point library</b> or <b>Data explorer</b> page, the "Updating KPIs..." dialog will no longer be displayed and the application will no longer attempt to add the  c8y_Global flag to each existing data point object on each refresh of the pages. Note: the flag will be set by default on initial save, but if you override this behavior in your custom application, you'll not fall into this dialog repeatedly. </td>
