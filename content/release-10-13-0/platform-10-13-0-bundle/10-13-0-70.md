Administration</td>
<td> In the SMS provider configuration certain tenant options can be inherited from the microservice owner tenant. Previously, this could not be determined from the UI. Now an additional hint (inherited from &#60;tenantID&#62;) will be displayed to denote that. </td>

MTM-38050</td>

Administration</td>
<td> The list items in <b>Data broker</b> &gt; <b>Data connectors</b> had a misaligned icon and title. This has been corrected by placing these elements in the same line. </td>

Administration</td>
<td> The navigation in the single sign-on authentication and Enterprise tenant configuration pages has been improved. All actionable elements are now visible without too much scrolling, for example, the enabled <b>Save</b> button is immediately visible after settings have been changed, instead of scrolling to the bottom of a long page. The layout of these pages was made consistent with the rest of the UI.</td>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td> The <b>Default subscriptions</b> page (previously under <b>Applications</b> and now under <b>Ecosystem</b> in the navigator of the Administration application) had several experience and layout problems. This has been fixed by correcting the title copy, moving the applications column to the left of both <b>Tenant creation</b> and <b>Platform update</b> checkbox columns and adding missing title properties for improved accessibility. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Core platform </td>
<td> The Inventory API has been enhanced to include information on the child hierarchy of a managed object, this improves both the API and the user interface.
<br>A new parameter <code>withChildrenCount</code> has been introduced for the endpoints <kbd>inventory/managedObjects</kbd> and <kbd>/inventory/managedObjects/{id}</kbd> which returns the number of managed objects in lists: childAdditions, childAssets, childDevices.
<br>It works as follows:
<br>- if not provided - number of documents is not returned (property is omitted)
<br>- for withChildrenCount=true - number of documents is returned
<br>- for withChildrenCount=false - number of documents is not returned (property is omitted)
<br>The parameter <code>withChildrenCount</code> can be used together with the parameter <code>withChildren</code> and for parameters <code>withChildrenCount=true&amp;withChildren=false</code> the endpoint will return the number of documents in assets without a list of documents. </td>
