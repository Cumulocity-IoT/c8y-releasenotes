<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td> Fixed the issue in the <b>Status</b> tab of an application, that it subscribes to the /managedobjects/* realtime channel, but does not unsubscribe from it when the user leaves the tab. Now this tab uses the /managedobjects/{{id}} realtime channel instead and correctly unsubscribes from it. It prevents the unnecessary communication between the UI application and core nodes (less realtime notifications), which otherwise could lead to higher resources usage on backend (CPU and memory). </td>
<td>
MTM-45279</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Authentication</td>
<td> Fixed an issue where a session was unintentionally removed for users logged in via OAI-Secure after renewing and revoking a token. </td>
<td>
MTM-44091</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Authentication</td>
<td> It is now possible to display all audit log entries related to auth configuration by filtering by "Tenant Auth configuration". </td>
<td>
MTM-45072</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Cloud Remote Access</td>
<td> Fixed an issue that prevented copying the Cloud Remote Access credentials when the Management tenant was not subscribed to the microservice. </td>
<td>
