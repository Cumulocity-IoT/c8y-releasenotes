<td>The performance of the <b>Users</b> page has been improved. Loading root users with a large number of sub-users (100+) now takes less than 1s, while previously, with a larger number of sub-users (around 500), it took around 30-60s. Moreover, the request to fetch all children of a root user is now up to 10 times faster, depending on the number of sub-users and the number of their global roles.</td>

<td>Trial tenants created in Software AG Cloud are by default forbidden to access the SSO configuration, to prevent its potential misconfiguration by users. A REST endpoint is used by the Management tenant to restrict or allow the access to configuration for specific tenants. Refer to <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide/administration/#configuration-access">Configuration access</a> in the <i>User guide</i> for more details.</td>
