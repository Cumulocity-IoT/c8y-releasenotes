Cumulocity IoT Edge Release 10.6, April 2020, includes the following improvements, fixes and known issues:

### Hosting microservices

You can now develop and deploy microservices in Cumulocity IoT Edge. For more information about enabling or disabling the microservice hosting feature, see [Enabling or disabling the microservice hosting feature](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.6.0/edge/installation/#enabling-or-disabling-microservice-hosting-feature).

This enhancement includes some changes to the monitoring and diagnostic utilities:

* Diagnostic utility changes:
	* The health of the Kubernetes platform components and the hosted microservices have been added to the list of health endpoints monitored by diagnostic monitor.
	* Diagnostic data collector collects the logs of the Kubernetes platform components as well as the logs of the hosted microservices. For more information, see [Microservices log file locations](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.6.0/edge/operation/#microservices-log-file-locations).

#### Supported microservices

Cumulocity IoT Edge supports all microservices developed for Cumulocity IoT Cloud including the [Cumulocity IoT Machine Learning](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.6.0/machine-learning/introduction/) offering.

### Support for remote access protocols

Cumulocity IoT Edge now supports the VNC and Telnet protocols to remotely access the Edge VM. See [Connecting to the cloud](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.6.0/edge/usage/#connecting-cloud).

### Support for OPC UA 2.0

OPC UA 2.0 is now available. For more information, see [Optional services > OPC UA](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.6.0/users-guide/optional-services/#opc-ua) in the User guide.

When you upgrade to Cumulocity IoT Edge version 10.6, the OPC UA agent configurations are lost. You must reconfigure all the OPC UA configurations.

### Cumulocity IoT DataHub

Cumulocity IoT DataHub is now available in the Cumulocity IoT Edge platform as an integrated application, available from the application switcher. For more information, see [Running DataHub on the Edge](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.6.0/datahub/running-datahub-on-the-edge/).

### Known issues

|<div style="width:100px">Ticket</div>|<div style="width:200px">Area</div>|Description
|:---|:---|:---
|CIE-852|VMware Workstation|**Issue:** On VMware Workstation, you should use UTC on your host machine. If you choose not to use UTC, you may have time sync issues.<br><br>**Workaround:** Set `rtc.diffFromUTC=0` in the .vmx file.|
|CIE-892|Virtual Box|**Issue:** On Virtual Box, you should use UTC on your host machine. If you choose not to use UTC, you may have time sync issues.<br><br>**Workaround:** Set the `VBoxInternal/Devices/mc146818/0/Config/UseUTC` key value to 1.|
|CIE-895|Device Management|**Issue:** In the Device Management application, when you click on a device in the **All devices** menu, the **Measurements** tab does not appear in the device information page even if there are measurements on the device.<br><br>**Workaround:** Refresh or reload the browser. If it doesn’t work, replace “device-info” with “measurements” in the URL.
|CIE-911|Edge agent registration|**Issue:** After upgrading from Edge version 10.5 to 10.6, you cannot register your Edge agent with Cumulocity tenant as you cannot access the */usr/edge/properties/edge-agent/device-id* file. You need the device ID to register your Edge agent with Cumulocity tenant.<br><br>**Workaround:** As a root user, change the ownership of the *edge-agent* folder using the command:<br>`chown -R edge-agent:edge-agent /usr/edge/properties/edge-agent`.
|CIE-1429|Microservices|**Issue:** Uploading a high number of microservices could result in low disk space of the installation disk and lead to instability.
|CIE-1429|Administration|**Issue:** Changing the hostname of the Edge VM is not supported.
