<td style="text-align:left">Apama Analytics Builder</td>
<td style="text-align:left">In the model manager, the user was not able to set a date for simulation mode using the date picker. This has been corrected, and the user can now use the date picker to select a date.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Apama-ctrl microservice</td>
<td style="text-align:left">When the Apama-ctrl microservice entered Safe mode, it did not disable all extensions. Thus, if an extension had a syntax error, Apama-ctrl could enter a restart loop as it would fail to start. This has been corrected, and Apama-ctrl now logs all extensions that are present but not loaded due to running in Safe mode.</td>
