See [Apama Analytics Builder for Cumulocity IoT](https://documentation.softwareag.com/onlinehelp/Rohan/Apama/v10-3-1/pas10-3-1/apama-pas-webhelp/index.html) for the complete documentation.

### Cumulocity IoT platform

Cumulocity IoT Edge 10.4 release is based on the 10.4.0 release of the Cumulocity IoT platform. Therefore all new features in the Administration, Cockpit and Device Management application and related APIs are now also available in Cumulocity IoT Edge.

Specifically new features are:

**Administration**

* Single sign-on with the OAuth2 protocol is now possible, including Azure AD integration. See [Administration > Changing settings > Configuring single sign-on](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.4.6/users-guide/administration/#single-sign-on) in the Users guide for details.
* In addition to the “username” used to authenticate a user, an administrator can now also specify a “login alias” for a user. This allows to change the displayed name (for example, after a change of name or email address) without changing the ID (username). The user can login using the original “username” or the “login alias”.
* An alarm is now raised when the data broker cannot connect to the cloud or when the queue is full.

**Cockpit**

* A new button **Clear all** to clear all alarms at once (after confirmation) has been added.

**Device Management**

*  Under **Device Registration**, the most recent pending device registration is shown on top.
* The “Group assignment” widget has been improved: the dropdown menu highlights matching groups and hides groups which do not contain the provided text in their name.
* It is now possible to delete device credentials when removing root devices.
* The event list in the **Events** tab can now be filtered by manually entering an event type.
* It is now possible to bulk-register devices from an uploaded list of serial numbers.
* Number of unresolved alarms by severity will be shown in alarms overview (also in Cockpit application).

**Other**

* A new version of the Web SDK has been released, supporting Angular version 7.
* With MQTT, devices can now be updated using JSON.

### VMWare as main hypervisor

With Cumulocity IoT Edge 10.4 release, VMWare-based hypervisors are the preferred choice for Cumulocity IoT Edge production installations. Detailed changes are:

* In addition to [VMware ESXi](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.4.6/edge/installation/#setting-up-esxi), [VMware Workstation Player](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.4.6/edge/installation/#setting-up-vmware) is supported.
* [VirtualBox](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.4.6/edge/installation/#setting-up-virtual-box) support is marked as “non production”.


### Edge packaging and installation

Edge installation has been improved as follows:

* The post-installation tool has been updated with more error checks, see [Setting up Cumulocity IoT Edge > Configuration](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.4.6/edge/installation/#configuration).
* The IP address is now easily configurable, see [Setting up Cumulocity IoT Edge > Accessing the Cumulocity IoT platform](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.4.6/edge/installation/#accessing-cumulocity).
* Disk size is now expandable.
* Time synchronization requirements are now documented.
* The email service is now configurable, see [Operating Cumulocity IoT Edge > Administration and configuration](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.4.6/edge/operation/#administration-configuration). This can be used to send “Forgot password” emails and to configure Smart Rules that send emails.
