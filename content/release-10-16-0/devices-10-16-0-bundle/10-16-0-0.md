<tr>
<td>Device Management</td>
<td>The <code>c8y-data-grid</code> component now offers a simpler mechanism for persisting grid configuration and enabling user-defined columns. By providing a "DataGridConfigurationStrategy" developers can enable user-defined columns for a given <code>c8y-data-grid</code> instance and define how and where the grid configuration is stored. In the <code>@c8y/ngx-component</code> a "UserPreferencesConfigurationStrategy" service is implemented that stores the grid configuration in form of user preferences. Additionally, custom columns have been enabled for sub assets and search results grids.</td>
<td>DM-1024</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Device Management</td>
<td>Core re-usable data-grid related components and services have been moved to the <code>@c8y/ngx-components</code> packages for easier use in components based on the <code>c8y-data-grid</code> component without the need to create dependencies to the <code>@c8y/ngx-components/device-grid</code>.</td>
<td>DM-1023</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>When the client sent data to the LWM2M agent for an unmapped event the agent triggered an alarm instead of creating an event. Now the LWM2M agent creates a <code>c8y_lwm2m_sendData</code> event. Otherwise, if there is already a mapping uploaded to the agent, the data is processed by the mapping engine.</td>
<td>DM-373</td>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td>The LWM2M agent now provides two operations on the connector device for manually invalidating LWM2M registrations.</td>
<td>
DM-1336</td>

<tr>
<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>LWM2M 1.1 allows direct writing to a resource instance. That means if you have a resource, which has some resource instances (for example, /3/0/11/0) and these resource instances allow direct writing, it's possible to write values to any of the resource instances.</td>
<td>DM-371</td>

<tr>
<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>The LWM2M bulk registration now also supports the creation of external IDs and extra fragments in managed objects like it is supported in the general bulk registration. Furthermore, it is now possible to assign LWM2M devices to groups as part of the LWM2M bulk registration process.</td>

LWM2M</td>
<td>The LWM2M agent now fetches a limited number of pending operations if an LWM2M device sends a registration or a registration update.</td>
<td>
DM-1474</td>

<tr>
<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>
- The LWM2M agent always retrieved the external decoder events from one month back only. So if an event remained unprocessed over a month, then it wasn't processed anymore. The time period is now configurable from the agent's configuration.
<br>
- Events, measurements, and alarms created by the LWM2M agent are flushed every 10 mins. If a high number of devices connects concurrently or in a short time period, the size of the queue can increase significantly, which in turn leads to high memory usage until all elements are flushed. The flush time interval can now be configured from the agent's properties.</td>
<td>DM-1602</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>
The external decoder service was using a single thread per event to parallelize the decoder event processing. Those threads were created from another execution thread which can lead to a deadlock on a tenant. To avoid such deadlocks, the processing of the decoder events is done in batches for each tenant. Additionally, a fail-safe mechanism has been introduced, so that the agent is able to release a tenant after a certain period of a deadlock.</td>
<td>DM-1519</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> The nodes of the OPC UA server address space contain hierarchical references that are used by the opcua-device-gateway to traverse the address space tree during the address space scans. The partial address space scans used to require the inverse hierarchical direction for the start node and its parent nodes. Now partial scan also works when the start node or its parent nodes do not contain the inverse hierarchical references.

Moreover, for better troubleshooting during scans debug/trace logs have been added to all opcua-device-gateway address space scanners.
For more details on how to enable them, see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.16.0/protocol-integration/opcua/#changing-the-log-level-for-troubleshooting" class="no-ajaxy">OPCUA > Troubleshooting</a> in the <i>Protocol integration guide</i>. </td>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> The OPC UA artefacts on Edge have the JVM heap size defined relative to the defined memory limit for the container. Security improvements have been added to limit the Docker capabilities. </td>
<td>
DM-1327</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> The OPCUA device gateway creates an application identity certificate to identify itself with the OPCUA server. During the upgrade of the OPCUA gateway from version 10.11 or earlier to 10.13 and later, the private key of this application identity is encrypted internally and saved. The encryption of the old identity was faulty in the earlier releases of 10.13 and later, which led to issues with the server connection using Sign or SignAndEncrypt security mode after the upgrade. This issue is now resolved. Users who configured the OPCUA server after the upgrade, or did a new configuration with 10.13 or later versions are unaffected by the issue. The issue was only during the encryption of old identities. </td>
<td>
DM-1246</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPCUA</td>
<td>In previous versions of the OPCUA management service users were allowed to save the OPCUA device protocols with invalid node IDs in the <b>Limit device protocol to specific root nodes ID</b> field while applying constraints. This led to an error during retrieval of the whole device protocols list. With the current release the node IDs are now validated before saving the device protocol. Wrong values will be shown in a popup.</td>
<td>
DM-822</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>OPC UA</td>
<td>Due to a change introduced in 10.14, the opcua-device-gateway on OPC UA server connects or reconnects did a full device type matching with a comparison of device types to the server's address space to find matched nodes and the application of these matched nodes. With this fix, the opcua-device-gateway directly applies the matched nodes settings if there was a matching done previously and no more recent updates to the device types were done.</td>
<td>DM-1651</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> Previously, when the <code>autoReconnect</code> property was enabled in the OPC UA server's client configuration, then on server connection drop, in addition to the Prosys client SDK auto-reconnect mechanism, the OPCUA device gateway did an additional reconnect. This led to issues with re-creating subscriptions to the server.
<br>
Now with <code>autoReconnect</code> enabled, only the Prosys client SDK does the auto-reconnect. If the <code>autoReconnect</code> property is disabled in the OPC UA server's client configuration, the OPCUA device gateway will do the reconnection itself by default. This OPC UA device gateway reconnect can also be disabled by setting the gateway configuration property <code>triggerManualReconnectOnConnectionDrop</code> to false. For details on the property, see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.16.0/protocol-integration/opcua/#gateway-register" class="no-ajaxy">OPCUA > Gateway configuration and registration</a> in the <i>Protocol integration guide</i>.  </td>
