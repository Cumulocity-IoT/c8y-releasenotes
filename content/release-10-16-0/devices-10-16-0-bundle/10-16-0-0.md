<tr>
<td>
Actility</td>
<td> Users can now configure the application server key, application server ID, core API version and admin API version in the UI while creating an Actility connection instead of configuring these values in the properties file.</td>
<td>
DM-1142; DM-1171</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Actility</td>
<td>The Actility agent now accepts both XML and JSON uplink messages from Thingpark Actility. Prior to this change, JSON messages had been denied.</td>
<td>
DM-1255</td>

<tr>
<td>
Actility</td>
<td>The Cumulocity IoT Actility agent is now able to register devices on Actility ThingPark Enterprise in addition to the registration via Actility Thingpark Wireless.</td>
<td>
DM-1102</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Device Management</td>
<td>Filtering by groups in the device grid component is now enhanced by a search. Users can now search and select assets through the hierarchy.</td>
<td>DM-1406</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Device Management</td>
<td>The <code>c8y-data-grid</code> component now offers a simpler mechanism for persisting grid configuration and enabling user-defined columns. By providing a "DataGridConfigurationStrategy" developers can enable user-defined columns for a given <code>c8y-data-grid</code> instance and define how and where the grid configuration is stored. In the <code>@c8y/ngx-component</code> a "UserPreferencesConfigurationStrategy" service is implemented that stores the grid configuration in form of user preferences. Additionally, custom columns have been enabled for sub assets and search results grids.</td>
<td>DM-1024</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Device Management</td>
<td>Core re-usable data-grid related components and services have been moved to the <code>@c8y/ngx-components</code> packages for easier use in components based on the <code>c8y-data-grid</code> component without the need to create dependencies to the <code>@c8y/ngx-components/device-grid</code>.</td>
<td>DM-1023</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>When the client sent data to the LWM2M agent for an unmapped event the agent triggered an alarm instead of creating an event. Now the LWM2M agent creates a <code>c8y_lwm2m_sendData</code> event. Otherwise, if there is already a mapping uploaded to the agent, the data is processed by the mapping engine.</td>
<td>DM-373</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td>The LWM2M agent now provides two operations on the connector device for manually invalidating LWM2M registrations.</td>
<td>
DM-1336</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA </td>
<td> DeviceTypeMappings of a managed object are now stored beside the device gateway to reduce the size of the managed object stored in the inventory. </td>
<td>
DM-304</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>OPC UA</td>
<td>The usage of Prometheus via JMX has been enabled to provide additional metrics of the current count of alarms and measurements. For details, see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.16.0/protocol-integration/opcua/#changing-the-log-level-for-troubleshooting" class="no-ajaxy">OPCUA > Troubleshooting</a> in the <i>Protocol integration guide</i>. The JAR file can be downloaded from the prometheus.io web page.</td>

<tr>
<td>
Cloud Remote Access</td>
<td> The behavior of the Cloud Remote Access UI functionality has been improved. The microservice subscription is now checked before the microservice health check, in order to prevent unnecessary delays on loading device details within the Device Management application for tenants which are not using this feature. </td>
<td>
MTM-44680</td>

<tr>

Device Management</td>
<td> In the device list view, when a custom column is added it is always positioned after all default columns. </td>
<td>
DM-1309</td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td> On a device grid, when applying filters to columns, this is now saved to the configuration for the grid, and when users returns to the same page the filters will be visualized and applied. </td>

Device Management</td>
<td>In the Device Management application, for example in the <b>Info</b> tab or the <b>Location</b> tab, the latitude position is now consistently displayed as first position value, followed by longitude.</td>
<td>
MTM-41052</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td>The data type mapping of the "Asset properties" widget has been improved to ignore null values for properties created by default when using MQTT templates, which prevented user from saving widget data unless the mentioned properties were fixed manually. Affected properties: c8y_Firmware.url, c8y_Software.url, c8y_Mobile.imei, c8y_Mobile.imsi, c8y_Mobile.cellId, c8y_Mobile.lac, c8y_Mobile.mcc, c8y_Mobile.mnc.</td>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td>The <b>Create smart group</b> button in the <b>All devices</b> list is clickable again when all column filters are cleared.</td>
<td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>Device Management</td>
<td>When removing a device with child devices, users can now choose either to remove a device user or to remove all child devices. Prior to this change, it was possible to choose both options in the UI, but such an action is not supported by the backend.</td>
<td>MTM-45277</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td>The LWM2M agent now fetches a limited number of pending operations if an LWM2M device sends a registration or a registration update.</td>
<td>
DM-1474</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> The nodes of the OPC UA server address space contain hierarchical references that are used by the opcua-device-gateway to traverse the address space tree during the address space scans. The partial address space scans used to require the inverse hierarchical direction for the start node and its parent nodes. Now partial scan also works when the start node or its parent nodes do not contain the inverse hierarchical references.

Moreover, for better troubleshooting during scans debug/trace logs have been added to all opcua-device-gateway address space scanners.
For more details on how to enable them, see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.16.0/protocol-integration/opcua/#changing-the-log-level-for-troubleshooting" class="no-ajaxy">OPCUA > Troubleshooting</a> in the <i>Protocol integration guide</i>. </td>
<td>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> The OPC UA artefacts on Edge have the JVM heap size defined relative to the defined memory limit for the container. Security improvements have been added to limit the Docker capabilities. </td>
<td>
DM-1327</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td> The OPCUA device gateway creates an application identity certificate to identify itself with the OPCUA server. During the upgrade of the OPCUA gateway from version 10.11 or earlier to 10.13 and later, the private key of this application identity is encrypted internally and saved. The encryption of the old identity was faulty in the earlier releases of 10.13 and later, which led to issues with the server connection using Sign or SignAndEncrypt security mode after the upgrade. This issue is now resolved. Users who configured the OPCUA server after the upgrade, or did a new configuration with 10.13 or later versions are unaffected by the issue. The issue was only during the encryption of old identities. </td>
<td>
DM-1246</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPCUA</td>
<td>In previous versions of the OPCUA management service users were allowed to save the OPCUA device protocols with invalid node IDs in the <b>Limit device protocol to specific root nodes ID</b> field while applying constraints. This led to an error during retrieval of the whole device protocols list. With the current release the node IDs are now validated before saving the device protocol. Wrong values will be shown in a popup.</td>
