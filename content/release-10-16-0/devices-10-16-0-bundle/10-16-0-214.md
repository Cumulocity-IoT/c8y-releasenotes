<td>LWM2M</td>
<td>Multi-line LWM2M post-operations were not executed right after the LWM2M device's new registration when realtime was disabled for the tenant who owns the device. As a result the device might not receive these operations until the next LWM2M device's registration update. This issue is now resolved and LWM2M post-operations are executed right after the LWM2M device's new registration, no matter whether realtime is enabled or not for this kind of devices.</td>
