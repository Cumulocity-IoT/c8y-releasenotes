See also [What's New In Apama 10.15.1](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pam/10.15.1/en/webhelp/pam-webhelp/index.html#page/pam-webhelp%2Fco-WhaNewInApa_10151_top.html)
in the Apama documentation.

### Improvements in Analytics Builder

The **Type** parameter of the [Selector](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pab/10.16.0/en/webhelp/pab-webhelp/index.html#page/pab-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Flow_Manipulation_Selector.html) 
block now supports JSON for setting the type of the output value. 
If **JSON** is selected as the type, all input parameter values must be valid JSON values of the same type.
If the **Type** parameter remains unselected, the type of the output value is set based on the types of all input parameter values. 
If all values are either `true` or `false`, the output is a `boolean` value. 
If all values are numbers, the output is a `float` value. In all other cases, the output is a `string` value.

The [Combiner](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pab/10.16.0/en/webhelp/pab-webhelp/index.html#page/pab-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Flow_Manipulation_Combiner.html) 
block now offers a new mode called **Latest Updated**. When selected, it outputs the latest updated value even if the actual value is unchanged. 
If multiple values update in a single activation, then the input port with the highest number is used. 
For clarity, the existing **Latest** mode has been renamed to **Latest Changed**.

The behavior of the [Discrete Statistics](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pab/10.16.0/en/webhelp/pab-webhelp/index.html#page/pab-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Aggregates_DiscreteStatistics.html) 
block has been corrected. The block no longer uses the previous discrete value when the state of the block is reset. 
If the **Sample** input port is not connected, every value is sampled. 
If a new value is received during the same activation period as a reset, the value is now sampled after the reset, otherwise it is ignored.

The value of the `timestamp` field of the `apama.analyticsbuilder.Value` event when used as an input value in a custom block was incorrect in some situations. 
This has been fixed so that the `timestamp` field now contains the correct timestamp of the value.

The following keys for configuring model timeouts have been removed and will be ignored when set: 
`default_timeout_secs` and `block_promise_timeout_secs`. 
Instead, warnings are now logged when request responses or returned promise values take too long to complete.
