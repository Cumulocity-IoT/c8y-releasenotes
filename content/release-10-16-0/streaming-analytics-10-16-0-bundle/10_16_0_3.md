<td style="text-align:left">Starting with release 10.16, the Cumulocity IoT platform performs more strict validations on incoming fields of email requests.
When the <code>bcc</code> field of the <code>com.apama.cumulocity.SendEmail</code> event was empty,
the Apama HTTP client transport for Cumulocity IoT incorrectly forwarded the <code>bcc</code> field as an empty string
instead of as a JSON array, causing requests to be rejected. This issue has now been resolved.</td>
