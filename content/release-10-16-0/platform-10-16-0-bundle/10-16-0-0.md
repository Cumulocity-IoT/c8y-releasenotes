<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td> When the user is logged in, then every request at <code>https://{url}/tenant/loginOptions</code> will now be sent with the <code>tenantId</code> parameter, so that the request looks like this:<br>
<code> https://{url}/tenant/loginOptions?tenantId={tenantId}</code>
<br>This improves logging via a tunnel and helps to avoid 401 errors. </td>

MTM-46604</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td> A context help drawer has been added to the <b>Data broker</b>, <b>Subtenants</b>, <b>Tenant statistics</b> and <b>All applications</b> pages. Moreover, the height has been changed to adapt to the drawer's content instead of having a fixed value. </td>
<td>
DM-1296</td>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td>On creating a new property in the <b>Properties library</b> you could only use letters and digits for its name. Now it is also allowed to use underscores.</td>
<td>
MTM-47277</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Administration</td>
<td>The tabs on the <b>Microservices</b> page, for example the <b>Logs</b> or the <b>Status</b> tab, are now correctly displayed after subscribing or unsubscribing a microservice. Moreover, a message is shown which informs about the status of the subscribing or unsubscribing process.</td>
<td>MTM-45285</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Administration</td>
<td>Tenant provisioning uses a new access mapping configuration, which allows the administrator to freely edit single sign-on (SSO) user roles. Only privileges that are listed in a predefined access mapping SSO configuration will be managed by the authentication server but others can be managed by the administrator.</td>
<td>MTM-47879</td>
</tr>

<td>
Authentication</td>
<td>In the <b>Authentication</b> page, if the forbidden or trusted user agents lists for a specific authentication configuration are empty, the removal button will no longer be displayed. Related inconsistencies in previous versions have been fixed. </td>
<td>
MTM-43723</td>

<td>
Core platform</td>
<td> Cumulocity IoT Core has been fully migrated to Java 11. </td>

Core platform</td>
<td>The identifier for managed objects is now a random number and no longer monotonically increasing.</td>
<td>
MTM-47763</td>

<tr>
<td>Core platform</td>
<td>The access mapping configuration has been extended with a new option <code>manageRolesOnlyFromAccessMapping</code>. This allows the authentication server to manage only the roles that are listed in the access mapping configuration. Other privileges which can be edited by the administrator will be unchanged after login. Therefore the single sign-on user can be managed by the platform as well as by the authentication server at the same time.</td>
<td>MTM-47878</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Data Broker</td>
<td>The databroker-agent server microservice (a key part of the microservice-based data broker) has been upgraded to use the more secure Cumulocity IoT microservice API version 2.
Additionally, a small change has been made to improve an existing error message which is logged when forwarding to the destination tenant fails.</td>
<td>
MTM-47731</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Inventory roles</td>
<td>For users with inventory role access only, the performance for GET requests for operations has been improved. The feature is hidden behind a feature toggle which is already used for other improvements. The tenant option to enable/disable the toggle has the following payload: <code>"category": "configuration", "key": "acl.algorithm-version", "value": "OPTIMIZED"/"LEGACY"</code>. For details, see the <a href="https://www.cumulocity.com/api" class="no-ajaxy">Cumulocity IoT OpenAPI Specification</a>.</td>
<td>
MTM-42354</td>

<tr>
<td>
MongoDB </td>
<td> To improve the query performance, the default sort order has been disabled for timeseries measurements. </td>
<td>
MTM-46924</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Notifications 2.0</td>
<td> Non-persistent Notifications 2.0 subscriptions and shared subscribers are now available; new fields to support these options are provided in the Cumulocity REST endpoint resources and in Java SDK. Non-persistent subscriptions do not persist message backlogs in the Cumulocity IoT Messaging Service; new and reconnected consumers will always start consuming from the most recent message in the subscription channel. They will have lower resource cost and should allow higher message rates. Shared subscriber tokens use a common name and set a field in the token to indicate they are shared. They can be used to divide consumer workloads across multiple client processes; each sharing client receives publish-ordered messages from a unique subset of devices publishing to the given subscription channel, allowing more scalable notification clients to be implemented while maintaining per-device message ordering and at-least-once delivery guarantees. For details, see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.15.0//reference/notifications/" class="no-ajaxy">Notifications 2.0<a/> in the <i>Reference guide</i>.</td>
<td>
MTM-42808</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Notifications 2.0</td>
<td>Introduced the possibility to filter queries on Notifications 2.0 subscriptions by additional fields:
<br>- "subscription" - the subscription name.
<br>- "typeFilter" - the type filter.  This will filter subscriptions by the <code>subscriptionFilter.typeFilter</code> field.
These new filtering capabilities are available via the REST API and the Java SDK. See the <a href="https://cumulocity.com/api/" class="no-ajaxy">Cumulocity IoT OpenAPI Specification</a> for more details of how to use the new query parameters.</td>
<td>MTM-46242</td>

<tr>
<td>
REST API</td>
<td>The <code>detail()</code> and <code>delete()</code> method of the @c8y/client MeasurementService is shown as deprecated as it is not supported with the new timeseries.</td>

MTM-48529</td>
</tr>

<tr>

<td>REST API</td>
<td>The REST method <code>GET /measurement/measurements/{id}</code> is no longer supported for timeseries measurements.</td>

<tr>
<td>REST API</td>
<td>The performance of the Alarm API has been improved for requests which use the resolved query parameter.</td>
<td>MTM-49450</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Security</td>
<td>An attribute was added to all external application links, that prevents tab nabbing, a security vulnerability that could be used to gain the user's browser session.</td>
<td>MTM-48156</td>
</tr>

<td>
Single sign-on</td>
<td>Trial tenants created in Software AG Cloud are by default not allowed to access the single sign-on configuration in Cumulocity IoT to prevent its potential misconfiguration by users. A REST endpoint is used by the Management tenant to restrict or allow the access to the configuration for specific tenants. Refer to <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.16.0/users-guide/administration/#configuration-access">Administration > Single sign-on > Configuration access</a> in the <i>User guide</i> for more details. </td>
<td>
MTM-32508</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Single sign-on</td>
<td>The single sign-on (SSO) configuration page has been extended by a new access mapping option. Instead of a checkbox which sets the mapping during each login or only during user creation, a radio button has been added. Now three options are available:
<br>- Perform access mapping for every login for all privileges (admin can not edit SSO user privileges)
<br>- Perform access mapping only on user creation (admin can edit SSO user privileges)  
<br>- Perform access mapping for every login for those privileges listed in the configuration (admin can edit SSO user privileges)</td>
<td>MTM-47903</td>

<td>
Core platform</td>
<td>The cached content-length header value is now always added only for HTTP/1.0 for the binary download endpoint <code>GET /inventory/binaries/{moID}</code>. This is done to correctly support the chunked Transport-Encoding for HTTP/1.1+ and fixes the issue where devices could not upgrade firmware because of the missing Transport-Encoding=chunked header.</td>
<td>
MTM-48010</td>

<td>Core platform</td>
<td>Deleting managed objects is no longer asynchronous. Delete requests will be blocked until the managed objects and the related data are deleted. Once status code 2xx is returned by the platform, all related data have been deleted. Prior to this change, the platform returned status code 2xx immediately and the operation was running asynchronously. When the operation was unsuccessful the managed objects remained.
The main reason for this change is to make the platform able to reliably delete large hierarchies.</td>

<td>Enterprise tenant</td>
<td>Due to a change introduced in release 10.14, when a certificate for an Enterprise tenant was uploaded with this version, it was persisted in a faulty way. Although it was possible to activate the certificate when using the new domain this certificate failed to be parsed and the platform certificate was returned as backup. This issue has been resolved. After activating the certificate, the new domain will now be served with the respective certificate.</td>
