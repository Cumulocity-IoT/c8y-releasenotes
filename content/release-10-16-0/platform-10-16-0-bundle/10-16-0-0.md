<tr>
<td>
Notifications 2.0</td>
<td> Non-persistent Notifications 2.0 subscriptions and shared subscribers are now available; new fields to support these options are provided in the Cumulocity REST endpoint resources and in Java SDK. Non-persistent subscriptions do not persist message backlogs in the Cumulocity IoT Messaging Service; new and reconnected consumers will always start consuming from the most recent message in the subscription channel. They will have lower resource cost and should allow higher message rates. Shared subscriber tokens use a common name and set a field in the token to indicate they are shared. They can be used to divide consumer workloads across multiple client processes; each sharing client receives publish-ordered messages from a unique subset of devices publishing to the given subscription channel, allowing more scalable notification clients to be implemented while maintaining per-device message ordering and at-least-once delivery guarantees. For details, see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.15.0//reference/notifications/" class="no-ajaxy">Notifications 2.0<a/> in the <i>Reference guide</i>.</td>
