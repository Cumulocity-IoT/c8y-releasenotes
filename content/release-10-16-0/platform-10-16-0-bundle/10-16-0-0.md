<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td> When the user is logged in, then every request at <code>https://{url}/tenant/loginOptions</code> will now be sent with the <code>tenantId</code> parameter, so that the request looks like this:<br>
<code> https://{url}/tenant/loginOptions?tenantId={tenantId}</code>
<br>This improves logging via a tunnel and helps to avoid 401 errors. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td> A context help drawer has been added to the <b>Data broker</b>, <b>Subtenants</b>, <b>Tenant statistics</b> and <b>All applications</b> pages. Moreover, the height has been changed to adapt to the drawer's content instead of having a fixed value. </td>

Administration</td>
<td> It is now possible to request the details of a SHARED application of a parent tenant from the subtenant via the endpoint <code>/application/applications/<appID></code>. </td>

Administration</td>
<td>On creating a new property in the <b>Properties library</b> you could only use letters and digits for its name. Now it is also allowed to use underscores.</td>

MTM-47277</td>
</tr>

<td>
Authentication</td>
<td>In the <b>Authentication</b> page, if the forbidden or trusted user agents lists for a specific authentication configuration are empty, the removal button will no longer be displayed. Related inconsistencies in previous versions have been fixed. </td>

MTM-43723</td>

<td>
Data Broker</td>
<td>The databroker-agent server microservice (a key part of the microservice-based data broker) has been upgraded to use the more secure Cumulocity IoT microservice API version 2.
Additionally, a small change has been made to improve an existing error message which is logged when forwarding to the destination tenant fails.</td>
<td>
MTM-47731</td>

<tr>
<td>
Inventory roles</td>
<td>For users with inventory role access only, the performance for GET requests for operations has been improved. The feature is hidden behind a feature toggle which is already used for other improvements. The tenant option to enable/disable the toggle has the following payload: <code>"category": "configuration", "key": "acl.algorithm-version", "value": "OPTIMIZED"/"LEGACY"</code>. For details, see the <a href="https://www.cumulocity.com/api" class="no-ajaxy">Cumulocity IoT OpenAPI Specification</a>.</td>

<td> To improve the query performance, the default sort order has been disabled for timeseries measurements. </td>

MTM-46924</td>

<tr>
<td>
Notifications 2.0</td>
<td> Non-persistent Notifications 2.0 subscriptions and shared subscribers are now available; new fields to support these options are provided in the Cumulocity REST endpoint resources and in Java SDK. Non-persistent subscriptions do not persist message backlogs in the Cumulocity IoT Messaging Service; new and reconnected consumers will always start consuming from the most recent message in the subscription channel. They will have lower resource cost and should allow higher message rates. Shared subscriber tokens use a common name and set a field in the token to indicate they are shared. They can be used to divide consumer workloads across multiple client processes; each sharing client receives publish-ordered messages from a unique subset of devices publishing to the given subscription channel, allowing more scalable notification clients to be implemented while maintaining per-device message ordering and at-least-once delivery guarantees. For details, see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.15.0//reference/notifications/" class="no-ajaxy">Notifications 2.0<a/> in the <i>Reference guide</i>.</td>
