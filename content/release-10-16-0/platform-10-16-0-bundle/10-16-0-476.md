<td>Core platform</td>
<td>Previously, the status for operations with a <code>failureReason</code> fragment could not be changed from FAILED, since the <code>failureReason</code> fragment was not allowed for other statuses. Now <code>failureReason</code> is automatically removed when moving an operation from the FAILED status.</td>

<tr>
<td>Microservices</td>
<td>Cumulocity IoT allows you to deploy microservices which may offer their own REST endpoints that can be used by Cumulocity IoT API client applications. In the <i>cumulocity.json</i> microservice manifest file you can optionally configure horizontal pod auto scaling using the <code>"scale": "AUTO"</code> configuration. When switching the value from "AUTO" to "NONE" the Kubernetes resource "horizontal pod auto scaler" was not removed again if the microservice was already subscribed at the time the new microservice version was uploaded. This problem is now fixed.</td>
