<td>
Java SDK</td>
<td> The following Maven dependency changes have been made in the <code>cumulocity-clients-java</code> SDK:
<br>- the internal model related dependencies with dedicated <code>java-client-model</code> have been replaced
<br>- a new svenson dependency dedicated for the SDK has been introduced which replaces the internal one
<br>- the javax validation dependency has been updated to <code>jakarta.validation-api</code> version 2.0.2
<br>If your microservice does not define explicit dependencies to the <code>core-model</code> or <code>application-model</code> no additional work should be required, otherwise you should remove the above dependencies and replace them with <code>java-client-model</code>.
<br>If your microservice already defines the javax validation dependency adjust the  version to the one from the SDK. </td>
