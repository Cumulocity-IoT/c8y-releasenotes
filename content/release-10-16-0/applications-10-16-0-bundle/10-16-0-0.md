<tr>
<td>
Java SDK</td>
<td> The following Maven dependency changes have been made in the `cumulocity-clients-java` SDK:
<br>- the internal model related dependencies with dedicated `java-client-model` have been replaced
<br>- a new `svenson` dependency dedicated for the SDK has been introduced which replaces the internal one
<br>- the javax validation dependency has been updated to `jakarta.validation-api` version 2.0.2
<br>If your microservice does not define explicit dependencies to the `core-model` or `application-model` no additional work should be required, otherwise you should remove the above dependencies and replace them with `java-client-model`.
<br>If your microservice already defines the javax validation dependency adjust the  version to the one from the SDK. </td>
