### Deprecation of Java 7 support for the Microservice SDK

The Cumulocity IoT Microservice SDK for Java, allows you to extend the functionality of the Cumulocity IoT platform with your own functionality. In order to guarantee the security and stability of microservices, starting with the April 2020 release (10.6.0) the Microservice SDK for Java will require at least Java 8. With the July 2020 release (10.6.6), the Microservice SDK will be based on Spring Boot 2.x. In case you are still developing with Java 7 you must migrate your application to Java 8 if you want to take advantage of the latest Microservice SDK version. If you must stay with Java 7 or cannot migrate to Spring Boot 2.x you can still use the Microservice SDK in version <= 10.5.7.

For details on the Microservice SDK for Java, see [Microservice SDK for Java](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.5.7/microservice-sdk/java/) in the *Microservice SDK guide*.

### Deprecation of breadcrumbs

The breadcrumb functionality which is currently available in the Cumulocity IoT UI for groups and devices is deprecated and will be removed with the April 2020 release (10.6.0).

### Disabling TLS 1.0 support on all public cloud instances

Encryption based on Transport Layer Security v1.0 will be disabled on all public Cumulocity IoT instances on July 1st, 2020. As all modern browsers do already support by default more recent versions of TLS we do not expect limitations for users. Devices connecting to Cumulocity IoT might need to be updated.
