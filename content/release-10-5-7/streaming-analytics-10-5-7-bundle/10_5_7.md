### Improvements in Apama EPL Apps and Apama Analytics Builder

Apama EPL Apps and Apama Analytics Builder now include diagnostic links in the UI that allow developers to download snapshots (ZIP files) of the current microservice status to help with debugging. The diagnostic snapshot contains recent microservice log entries, Apama-internal diagnostics information, a copy of all EPL apps, smart rules and Analytics Builder models, a copy of any alarms that the microservice has raised, CPU profiling, environment information (tenant details, environment variables) and version numbers of the components. For detailed information, see [Troubleshooting and diagnostics](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.5.7/apama/troubleshooting/) in the *Streaming Analytics guide*.

The following example screenshot shows the two new diagnostics links at the bottom of the Apama EPL Apps starting page, one for downloading basic diagnostics information and another for downloading enhanced (more resource-intensive) diagnostics information:
