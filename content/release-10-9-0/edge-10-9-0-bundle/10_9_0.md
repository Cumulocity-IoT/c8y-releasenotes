Cumulocity IoT Edge Release 10.9, August 2021, includes the following improvements, fixes and known issues.

Download Cumulocity IoT Edge version 10.9 from [Software AG Empower portal](https://empower.softwareag.com), based on the target hypervisor.

### New installation, configuration and update model

You can now perform the installation, configuration and update of Cumulocity IoT Edge using the GUI and REST APIs. In previous releases, you had to use the terminal to perform these tasks. For more information, see [Installing Cumulocity IoT Edge](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.9.0/edge/installation/) and [Configuring Cumulocity IoT Edge](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.9.0/edge/configuration/).

### Other changes

- HTTP port 80 has been removed

### Deprecation of TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1

Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 and 1.1 are formally deprecated as of March 2021. For more information, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8996.

This RFC changes the requirement to reject TLS 1.0 and 1.1 from "SHOULD NOT" negotiate these versions to "MUST NOT" negotiate.

The RFC lists the reasons for the deprecation in the “1. Introduction” section. These protocol versions are vulnerable to attacks and no longer considered secure.

The devices that still use TLS 1.0 and 1.1 must be reconfigured to use a minimum of TLS 1.2 or later versions.

### Known issues

|<div style="width:100px">Ticket</div>|<div style="width:200px">Area</div>|Description
|:---|:---|:---
|CIE-670<br>CIE-2060|Device Management|**Issue:** The default linux-agent created in VMware appears as **VMware None (linux-agent)**.<br><br>**Workaround:** Change the name of the linux-agent in the Device Management application.
|CIE-852|VMware Workstation|**Issue:** On VMware Workstation, you should use UTC on your host machine. If you choose not to use UTC, you may have time sync issues.<br><br>**Workaround:** Set `rtc.diffFromUTC=0` in the .vmx file.
|CIE-2072|Microservices|**Issue:** GET response of `/edge/configuration/microservices` is not consistent. If you have restarted the Edge appliance or just enabled the microservices, for a short period the GET response might return that the microservices are not enabled.<br><br>**Workaround:** After restarting the Edge appliance or changing the configuration of the Edge appliance (for example, configuring the network or enabling microservices), wait at least 60 seconds before making a request to `/edge/configuration/microservices` to ensure it is up-to-date.
|CIE-2124|Network configuration|**Issue:** The blue-screen network-configurator does not reflect the new network parameters when updated through the GUI or REST API.<br><br>**Workaround:** Restart the Edge appliance.
|CIE-2127|Administration|**Issue:** Complex C8Y password causes failure in setting up the Management tenant and the logged password.<br><br>**Workaround:** Do not use passwords with quotes or curly braces.
|CIE-2132|Network configuration|**Issue:** "Unable to get network configuration information" on the **Network** tab.<br><br>**Workaround:** Configure the network using the blue-screen network-configurator.
|CIE-2331|Administration|**Issue:** Switching the Edge agent URL fails as the device credentials are cached. This causes the registration to fail when connected to another Cumulocity IoT tenant URL.<br><br>**Workaround:** Delete the credentials from the location */usr/edge/properties/edge-agent/workspace/storage/credentials_B0Y4g3TPhbQkEeY*. Also, delete these credentials when you disable remote-connectivity.
|CIE-2342|Administration<br>Installation|**Issue:** Google Chrome browser handles the self-signed SSL website differently in Windows and in Macintosh platforms. Unlike in Windows, in Macintosh platform, the **Proceed to** link does not appear in the Chrome browser.
