<!--10.7.1.0 - 10.7.19.0; 10.9.0.0 - 10.9.0.12-->

### Known issues

In the Administration application, the "Default subscriptions" page, in which you can configure which applications are subscribed to a tenant per default on tenant creation, is currently not correctly displaying the list of applications. The issue will be fixed with the maintenance release 10.9.0.15. You can still use REST API to configure the default subscriptions, see [Tenant API](https://cumulocity.com/api/10.9.0/#tag/Tenant-API) in the <i>Cumulocity IoT OpenAPI Specification</i>.
