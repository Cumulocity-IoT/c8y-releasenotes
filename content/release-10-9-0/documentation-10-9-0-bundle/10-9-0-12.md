### New guides

#### OpenAPI specification

A new OpenAPI Specification for the Cumulocity IoT REST API is available at [https://cumulocity.com/api/10.9.0](https://cumulocity.com/api/10.9.0). The new specification describes the entire Cumulocity IoT REST API (that is, available endpoints, operations on each endpoint, input and output for each operation, authentication methods and more) following the OpenAPI 3.0 standard.

The new specification is an enhancement of the former *Reference guide* and replaces it, starting with release 10.9.0.

#### Release notes

A new release notes presentation is available which combines the release notes from all versions (back to GA release 10.4.0) and from all Cumulocity IoT products (Core platform, Edge, Streaming Analytics, Machine Learning, DataHub) at one page.
