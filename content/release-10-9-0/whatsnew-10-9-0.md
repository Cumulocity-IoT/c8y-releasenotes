### Open API specification

A new Open API Specification for the Cumulocity IoT REST API is available at [https://cumulocity.com/api](https://cumulocity.com/api). The new specification describes the entire Cumulocity IoT REST API (that is, available endpoints, operations on each endpoint, input and output for each operation, authentication methods and more) following the OpenAPI 3.0 standard.

The new specification is an enhancement of the former *Reference guide* and replaces it, starting with release 10.9.0.


### NEW Loriot LoRa microservice

Cumulocity IoT can now interface with LORIOT Network Server through the Loriot agent microservice. You can:

* Configure the Loriot agent endpoint in LORIOT Network Server using Cumulocity data forwarder.
* Assign a device protocol for the LoRa device for payload processing.
* Decode upstream payload packets using a web-based user interface.
* Post-process raw device data through Cumulocity IoT events.
* Make use of existing Cumulocity IoT features with LoRa devices, like connectivity monitoring, device management, data visualization with dashboards, real-time analytics and more.

For details, refer to [Loriot LoRa](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.9.0/protocol-integration/lora-loriot/) in the *Protocol integration guide*.

### Cockpit

#### NEW reports page

All reports are now displayed under a separate <b>Reports</b> menu item in the navigator. You can create, update and delete reports from this page, but no longer from the **Plus** button in the top bar. The reports look & feel has been updated to align with the dashboards. Also, it is now possible to configure a report to become a top-level navigator menu item.

The <b>Exports</b> menu item has been moved under the <b>Configuration</b> menu.
