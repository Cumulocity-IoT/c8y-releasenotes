Cumulocity IoT Edge Release 10.5, November 2019, includes the following improvements, fixes and known issues:

### Remote device management

You can now register and manage your Cumulocity IoT Edge VM remotely from your Cumulocity IoT tenant. You must first configure the Edge agent (see [Configuration](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.5.0/edge/installation/#configuration)) and then register the Edge VM with the Cumulocity IoT tenant (see [Registering the Edge device with the Cumulocity tenant](https:/cumulocity.com/guides/10.5.0/edge/usage/#registering-the-edge-device-with-the-cumulocity-tenant)).

### Support for Microsoft Hyper-V

You can now import and setup your Edge appliance using Microsoft Hyper-V on Windows 10 Pro and Windows 10 Enterprise, version 1809. See [Example setup for Hyper-V](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.5.0/edge/installation/#setting-up-hyper-v).

### Post installation

A new parameter is added in the *config.dat* file.<br>If you are running the post-installation script using the *config.dat* file, there is a new  parameter required in that file called `cloud.url`. If you do not want to specify a cloud URL, use an empty string as the value. This is relevant for customers who are performing automated runs of the post-installation by specifying an existing file.

### Custom rules

After upgrading to Edge version 10.5, you must upload the custom rules from an older installation again. The custom rules are not migrated automatically during the upgrade process.

### Apama

* Cumulocity IoT Edge Release 10.5 includes Apama 10.5.0.
* If you are upgrading to Cumulocity IoT Edge version 10.5 from any previous version, note that you must redeploy all of your EPL files. See [Apama streaming analytics - New code editor and manager](/release-10-4-6/platform-devices-10-4-6/#apama-streaming-analytics---new-code-editor-and-manager).
