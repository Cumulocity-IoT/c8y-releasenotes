### New EPL sample

A new EPL sample named "Receive update notifications"
can now be accessed from the EPL editor of the Streaming Analytics application.
It shows how to write an EPL app that can distinguish between notifications for creating and updating managed objects, measurements, alarms, events, and operations.
See also [Developing apps with the Streaming Analytics application](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.19.0/streaming-analytics/epl-apps/#epl-apps)
in the *Streaming Analytics* guide.

For more detailed information, see [Receiving update notifications](https://documentation.softwareag.com/pam/10.15.3/en/webhelp/pam-webhelp/index.html#page/pam-webhelp%2Fco-ConApaAppToExtCom_cumulocity_receiving_update_notifications.html) in the Apama documentation for the Cumulocity IoT transport connectivity plug-in.

### Improvements in Analytics Builder

The **Type** parameter of the [Constant Value](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.19.0/streaming-analytics/block-reference/#constant-value) block
now supports float and boolean value types, in addition to the existing string and JSON types.
The **Type** parameter is now optional. If a type is not selected, the type of the output value is set based on the type of the input parameter value.
