Issue</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td > After removing delegated users, audit logs were not displayed for the shared user manager role and an error message "Cannot find document with ID" was displayed. The issue has been fixed by making sure that such events do no longer prevent audit logs from being displayed. </td>
<td>
MTM-37679</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td > New SIM providers can now be added in the <b>Connectivity</b> page (<b>Settings</b> > <b>Connectivity</b>). The SIM provider settings use the JSON schema declaring the properties required to configure a given SIM provider, and will display a dialog in which users can create, update and delete their provider configuration. </td>
<td>
MTM-37983</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td > The performance when paging the file repository with a large number of inventory binaries has been significantly improved.</td>
<td>
MTM-37890</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Authentication</td>
<td > To improve the audit logs, information on password change and reset is now included. </td>
<td>
MTM-38378</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Authentication</td>
<td > To improve the audit logs, user logins and login failures from oAuth Internal are now included. </td>
<td>
MTM-38384</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Authentication</td>
<td > To improve the audit logs, information on single sign-on user logins is now included. </td>
<td>
MTM-38383</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
CEP (Esper)</td>
<td > Some Java library calls have been disabled in this release for security reasons. If you have Esper CEL that uses Java system calls, you should test your application carefully in an upgraded test environment before upgrading your production environment. </td>
<td>
MTM-37710</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Cloud Remote Access</td>
<td > Security for the Cloud Remote Access configuration has been improved. The data broker will not transfer the Cloud Remote Access configuration managedObjects fragment to the destination tenant. </td>
<td>
MTM-30013</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
REST API</td>
<td > The Inventory API has been improved with a new "hasany()" function which now accepts multiple parameters. This means that on a query it is possible to use a single statement rather than multiple OR statements. For example: /inventory/managedObjects?query=$filter=hasany(c8y_IsDynamicGroup, c8y_Status) </td>
<td>
MTM-38270</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Two-factor authentication</td>
<td > The <b>Limit Token Validity</b> field has been disabled for OAuth Internal. A popup message has been added which informs the user that in case of OAuth Internal the JWT token validity is used so that the field cannot be edited. </td>
<td>
MTM-37723</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
UI </td>
<td > In order to align the UI with the new Software AG design, the previously used "font awesome" icons have been replaced by a new set of icons. All CSS classes with the prefix <code>fa-** </code> are now updated to use the <code>dlt-c8y-icon-** </code> prefix, keeping the icon name unchanged. The c8y-icon directive has also been updated to reflect this behavior.
For consistency, developers should use these icons, following the c8y-icon directive. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Administration</td>
<td > Tenant domains used to allow underscore signs (_). However, those characters are not allowed in wildcard certificates (such as subdomain.cumulocity.com). Now underscores are no longer allowed in tenant domains.</td>

<td>
Core product</td>
<td > Fixed handling big values for measurements provided via scientific notation. Values are now stored as floating point type.</td>

<td>
MTM-36963</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
MQTT</td>
<td > The JWT token can now be generated for devices authenticated with certificates regardless of the preferred login mode set (Basic, OAuth Internal). Previously it was only possible when the login mode was set to OAuth Internal.</td>
<td>
MTM-35965</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Realtime</td>
<td > Improved performance of creation and update of events and alarms for the devices in the deeper hierarchies. Because of the cache, the realtime notification from the children can be missed on the UI dashboards shortly after changing the device parents (in the first 5 minutes).</td>
<td>
MTM-37336</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
REST API</td>
<td > In some instances error messages were thrown as suspended tenant/s subscriptions were being removed from the system. This has been resolved.</td>
<td>

<td>
REST API</td>

<tr>
<td>
REST API</td>
<td > Numbers provided in scientific notation in REST requests will now be deserialized directly to 64 bit IEEE-754 floating point type (Double). This prevents "integer overflow" responses in corner cases.</td>
