### Apama correlator version

This release of Cumulocity IoT Streaming Analytics includes the Apama version 10.7.2 correlator. See also [What's New In Apama 10.7.2](https://documentation.softwareag.com/onlinehelp/Rohan/Apama/v10-7/apama10-7/apama-webhelp/index.html#page/apama-webhelp%2Fco-WhaNewInApa_1072_top.html) in the Apama documentation.

### Improvements for time zone support

In smart rules (and also in the Text Substitution block, see below), it is now possible to specify a time zone for `#{time}` substitutions, in the format `#{time:TZ=America/New_York}`.
See also [Cockpit > Smart rules collection](https://cumulocity.com/guides{{< 10-10-0 >}}/users-guide/cockpit/#smart-rules-collection) in the *User guide*.

You can now use a tenant option to set the time zone used for `on all at` timers. To set the tenant option, specify the `microservice.runtime` category and the `timezone` key.
This tenant option is only read when the microservice starts. If the tenant option is changed, the microservice only picks this up on the next microservice subscription.
See also [Advanced features > Listeners](https://cumulocity.com/guides{{< 10-10-0 >}}/apama/advanced/#Listeners) in the *Streaming Analytics guide*.

### Improvements in Analytics Builder

The documentation for [Analytics Builder](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-10-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html), including release notes,
is available separately. For your convenience, the release notes from the above documentation are also given below:

- An issue which prevented connecting `any` type outputs to blocks which take `float` as input has been fixed.
  The [Expression](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-10-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Calculations_Expression.html)
  block has also been updated to handle `any` type inputs.

- The [Pulse](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-10-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Flow_Manipulation_Pulse.html)
  block now has a new **Mode** parameter. Its default reflects the block's previous behavior: it sends a pulse when the value changes.
  Using this new parameter, you can now configure the block to send a pulse on every input or on every non-zero value.
  See also [Type conversions](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-10-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fco-AnaBui_type_conversions.html) in the Analytics Builder documentation.

- The [Text Substitution](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-10-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Utilities_TextSubstitution.html)
  block now supports time zone values. You can now specify a `:TZ=<timezone>` suffix to use a different time zone,
  for example, `#{time:TZ=America/New_York}` to use the time zone for New York.

- The **Property Name** parameter of the [Extract Property](https://documentation.softwareag.com/apama/Analytics_Builder/pab10-10-0/apama-pab-webhelp/index.html#page/apamaanalyticsbuilder-webhelp%2Fre_AnaBui_block_reference_Utilities_ExtractProperty.html)
  block has been renamed to **Property Path** as it also accepts a path. This is only a label change. You do not need to change existing models.
  They will continue to work as before.
