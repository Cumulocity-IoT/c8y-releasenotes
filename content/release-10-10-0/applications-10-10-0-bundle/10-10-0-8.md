Java SDK</td>
<td > The Java SDK has been updated to use the Jersey 2.33 library. As a result, if you update your Java SDK library you will have to change some of the classes used. For further information, see the Migration guide which is available at <a href="https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/documentation/latest/migration.html#mig-1.x" class="no-ajaxy">https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/documentation/latest/migration.html#mig-1.x</a>. </td>

<td>
Web SDK </td>
<td > Developers who use the WebSDK to build their own UI applications, can now more easily re-use the components from the @c8y/ngx-components/operations package as these have been split into finer-grained modules. This enables the components to be used individually and gives more flexibility for re-using components comprising the <b>Bulk operations</b> page in the standard Device management application to build similar pages in custom applications. Developers can now for example re-use a component to display single bulk operation details, easily display a list of bulk operation in their application or create a bulk operation creation wizard using only a subset of the standard provided bulk operation types and/or defining custom ones.</td>

<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td > When a new application is created using the Web SDK CLI (c8ycli), the branding options are now set by default. This way the tenant branding configuration will now always be applied to all custom applications created with the Web SDK CLI. </td>

MTM-37259</td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td > The <code>preventDuplicates</code> flag added to the <code>NavigatorNodeData</code> interface allows multiple modules to independently declare the same navigator node. Setting the flag to <code>true</code> will prevent the node to appear more than once in the navigator if one or more other modules have also declared it. Two nodes are considered a duplicate if they have the same <code>path</code>, <code>label</code> and <code>parent</code>. </td>

<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td > The Web SDK has been enhanced to allow the <code>ProviderConfigurationModule</code> to support tabs as part of its navigation. The JSON object will optionally contain a tab definition; this tab will then be displayed in the view for that navigation path. </td>

<td>
Web SDK</td>
<td > The <code>DynamicFormsUIThemeModule</code> (@c8y/ngx-components) provides a UI library with form controls to build dynamic forms with the <code>DynamicFormsModule</code> (@c8y/ngx-components) based on Angular Formly. The library has been extended with a file picker/drop area control allowing developers to declare file inputs in their dynamic forms. The type can be declared in both Formly schema (<code>type: 'file'</code>) and JSON schema. In the case of JSON schema every property having <code>contentEncoding</code> and/or <code>contentMediaType</code> properties defined will be mapped to <code>type: 'file'</code>. </td>

<tr>
<td>
Web SDK </td>
<td > In order to align the UI with the new Software AG design, the previously used "font awesome" icons have been replaced by a new set of icons. All CSS classes with the prefix <code>fa-** </code> are now updated to use the <code>dlt-c8y-icon-** </code> prefix, keeping the icon name unchanged. The c8y-icon directive has also been updated to reflect this behavior. <code>fa-** </code> utility classes were also changed and now use a more generic prefix: <code>icon-** </code>.
For consistency, developers should use these icons, following the c8y-icon directive. </td>
