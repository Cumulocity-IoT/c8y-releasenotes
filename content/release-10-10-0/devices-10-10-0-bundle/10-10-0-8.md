<td>
Device Monitoring</td>
<td > Audit records will now be created if the device availability is one of: enabled, disabled, the interval assigned to the device has changed, the device is set into maintenance state. </td>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td > After a LWM2M device is registered against Cumulocity IoT, post registration operations (if specified) will be sent to the device. With this enhancement, only post registration operations which carry a path to an existing LWM2M object on the respective device and operations without a path will be sent. This enhancement optimizes the communication between the platform and the device. </td>

OPC UA</td>
<td > Improved the HTTP POST retry mechanism by prioritizing the requests, introducing max queue size, no retry HTTP codes. </td>
<td>
MTM-37227</td>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td > To optimize performance, alarm mappings are now stored in-memory with a file based backup &amp; recovery mechanism. This is to minimize REST calls to the event API. </td>
<td>
MTM-35291</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td > OPC UA now supports regular expressions in browse path mappings.

<tr>
<td>
Bulk operations</td>
<td > In the operations section of the bulk operation details, long descriptions broke the correct formatting and visibility of table elements. This has been fixed by limiting/truncating the description text.</td>
<td>
MTM-38433</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Bulk operations</td>
<td > Bulk operations with status EXECUTING have a cancel option. When all single operations had been created and the user tried to cancel the bulk operation an error occurred. This has been resolved by removing the option to cancel a bulk operation when all its single operations have already been created.</td>
<td>
MTM-38907</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Bulk operations</td>
<td > Previously bulk operations that were started but not completed became stuck in platform failover scenarios. A mechanism to resume these bulk operations upon restart has been introduced.</td>
<td>
MTM-38171</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Device Management</td>
<td > The sorting of groups and devices has been changed to be consistent in all places. Previously the sorting of groups and devices in the navigator was not consistent with the sorting in the <b>Subassets</b> tab. Now the sorting will be case-sensitive in both cases, for example "AAA BBB CCC aaa bbb..." instead of "aaa AAA bbb CCC ccc...".</td>
<td>
MTM-36844</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Device Monitoring</td>
<td > Under certain circumstances, the availability status of devices could show wrong information. This has been fixed so the availability status now is always accurate. The availability calculation now also takes into account correctly the setting for "0" as documented.</td>
<td>
MTM-36103</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Device Monitoring</td>
<td > In the case that availability monitoring for a device was deactivated, alarms were still incorrectly being raised to indicate a device was unavailable. This behaviour has now been corrected.</td>
<td>
MTM-37863</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td > The LWM2M agent did not correctly reflect the status of an operation when it was cancelled in the UI. The agent has been modified to check if an operation has been cancelled before updating the status of that operation.</td>
<td>
MTM-37101</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
LWM2M</td>
<td > The LWM2M agent now processes also values that are part of an observe response message.</td>
<td>
MTM-37731</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td > The OPC UA UI now correctly shows an error message if the queue size or the sampling interval is too large.</td>
<td>
MTM-37556</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td > If measurements overflow the range of a Long while converting from Java BigDecimal we convert them now to Double values.</td>
<td>
MTM-37719</td>

<tr>
<td>
OPC UA</td>
<td > Improved extended node ID parsing with semicolons in the node ID value.</td>
<td>
MTM-37294</td>

<td>
Smartrest 2.0</td>
<td > The SmartRest response template CSV preview is now correctly displaying all data.</td>
