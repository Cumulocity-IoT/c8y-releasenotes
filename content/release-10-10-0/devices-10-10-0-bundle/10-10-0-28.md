LWM2M</td>
<td> The LWM2M agent operation handler now handles a Californium library's connector error by setting the operation back to pending state to process the operation later on. This kind of error can happen when sending an operation to a device and there is no longer a DTLS connection with the URI that is used. </td>

LWM2M</td>
<td> String resources can now again be mapped into measurement values, that is the LWM2M agent accepts numeric (integer and float) values sent as a string. In addition also the following strings will be treated as  numeric values:
<br> - Any positive or negative numeric sequence with leading 0 (zero) will be interpreted as octal value, but will be transformed and stored as a decimal number
<br> - Any positive or negative alphanumeric sequence containing letters from A to F, starting with 0x will be interpreted as hex value, but will be transformed and stored as a decimal number
<br>
Strings which do not meet these requirement won't be processed and an error message will be logged. See also <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides{{< 10-10-0 >}}/protocol-integration/lwm2m/#overview" class="no-ajaxy">LWM2M > Overview</a> in the <i>Protocol integration guide</i>. </td>
