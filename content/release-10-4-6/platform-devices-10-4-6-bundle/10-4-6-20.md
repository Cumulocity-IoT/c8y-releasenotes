Release 10.4.6.20 has implemented an improvement, which allows to calculate more accurate statistics on resource consumption of microservices. Currently, this can lead to high CPU load when subscriptions of microservices change frequently.

We will improve this in one of the following Maintenance releases and will keep you informed.

As a workaround to limit CPU costs for this calculation we recommend the following configuration change.

On all core nodes, add the following to */etc/cumulocity/cumulocity-core.properties*:

		"concurrency.tenant-usage-flush.core-pool-size" => "1"
		"concurrency.tenant-usage-flush.rejected" => "DISCARD"
		"concurrency.tenant-usage-flush.queue-size" => "1000”

The preferred way of doing this is to apply the changes to the Chef server environment configuration.
